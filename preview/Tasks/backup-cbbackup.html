  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Backing up with <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp></h1>

  <div class="body">
    <p class="p"> The <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp> tool is a flexible backup command that enables you to backup
      both local data and remote nodes and clusters involving different combinations of your
      data:</p>

    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Single bucket on a single node</li>

      <li class="li">All the buckets on a single node</li>

      <li class="li">Single bucket from an entire cluster</li>

      <li class="li">All the buckets from an entire cluster</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="p">Backups can be performed either locally, by copying the files directly on a single node, or
      remotely by connecting to the cluster and then streaming the data from the cluster to your
      backup location. Backups can be performed either on a live running node or cluster, or on an
      offline node.</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp> command stores data in a format that enables 
     easy restoration. When restoring, using `cbrestore`, you can restore back to a cluster of
      any configuration. The source and destination clusters do not need to match if you used
      `cbbackup` to store the information.</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp> command will copy the
      data in each course from the source definition to a destination backup directory. The backup
      file format is unique to Couchbase and enables you to restore, all or part of the backed up
      data when restoring the information to a cluster. Selection can be made on a key (by regular
      expression) or all the data stored in a particular vBucket ID. You can also select to copy the
      source data from a bucketname into a bucket of a different name on the cluster on which you
      are restoring the data.</p>
<p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp> command takes the following
      arguments:</p>

    
    <pre class="pre codeblock">cbbackup [options] [source] [backup_dir] </pre>

    
    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> The <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp> tool is located within the standard Couchbase
      command-line directory. <p class="p">Be aware that <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp> does not support external IP
      addresses. This means that if you install Couchbase Server with the default IP address, you
      cannot use an external hostname to access it.</p>
 </div>

    
    <p class="p">The following are <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup [options]</samp> arguments:</p>
 
    
    <p class="p">These options are used to configure username and password information for connecting to
    the cluster, backup type selection, and bucket selection. One or more options can be used.
    The primary options select what will be backed up by <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp>, including: </p>

    
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">--single-node
        <p class="p">Only back
          up the single node identified by the source specification.</p>

      </li>

      <li class="li">--bucket-source or -b
        <p class="p">Backup only
          the specified bucket name.</p>

      </li>

    </ul>

    
    <p class="p">The following are <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup [source]</samp> arguments:</p>

    <p class="p">The source for the data, either a local data directory
      reference, or a remote node/cluster specification:</p>

    
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Local Directory Reference
        <p class="p">A local
          directory specification is defined as a URL using the `couchstore-files` protocol. For example:</p>

        <samp class="ph codeph">couchstore-files:///opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data/default</samp>
        <p class="p">Using this method you
          are specifically backing up the specified bucket data on a single node only. To backup an entire
          bucket data across a cluster, or all the data on a single node, you must use the cluster node
          specification. This method does not backup the design documents defined within the bucket.</p>

      </li>

      <li class="li">cluster node
        <p class="p">A node or node within a cluster, specified as a URL to the node or cluster
          service. For example:</p>

        <pre class="pre codeblock">http://HOST:8091

// For distinction you can use the couchbase protocol prefix:
    couchbase://HOST:8091


// The administrator and password can also be combined with both forms of the URL for authentication. 
If you have named data buckets (other than the default bucket) that you want to backup, 
specify an administrative name and password for the bucket:

    couchbase://Administrator:password@HOST:8091 
        </pre>

      </li>

    </ul>

    
    <p class="p">The combination of additional options specifies whether the supplied URL refers to the entire
    cluster, a single node, or a single bucket (node or cluster). The node and cluster can be remote
    (or local). This method also backs up the design documents used to define views and indexes. </p>

    
    <p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup [backup_dir]</samp> argument is 
      the directory where the backup data files will be stored on the node on which the
      <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp> is executed. This must be an absolute, explicit, directory, as the files will be
    stored directly within the specified directory; no additional directory structure is created to
    differentiate between the different components of the data backup. The directory that you
    specify for the backup should either not exist, or exist and be empty with no other files. If
    the directory does not exist, it will be created, but only if the parent directory already
    exists. The backup directory is always created on the local node, even if you are backing up a
    remote node or cluster. The backup files are stored locally in the backup directory specified.
    Backups can take place on a live, running, cluster or node for the IP.</p>

    
    <p class="p">Using this basic
    structure, you can backup a number of different combinations of data from your source cluster.
    Examples of the different combinations are provided below: </p>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Backup all nodes and all buckets</h2>
      
      <p class="p">To backup an entire cluster, consisting of all the buckets and all the node data:</p>

      
      
<pre class="pre codeblock">cbbackup http://HOST:8091 /backups/backup-20120501 \ 
    -u Administrator -p password 
    [####################] 100.0% (231726/231718 msgs)

          : 
               total |     last | per sec 
    batch :     5298 |     5298 | 617.1 
    byte  : 10247683 | 10247683 | 1193705.5 
    msg   :   231726 |   231726 | 26992.7 
done 
    [####################] 100.0% (11458/11458 msgs)

    msg   :       84 |       84 | 643701.2 
done   
</pre>

      
      <p class="p">When backing up multiple buckets, a progress
      report, and summary report for the information transferred will be listed for each bucket
      backed up. The `msgs` count shows the number of documents backed up. The `byte` shows the
      overall size of the data document data.</p>

    <p class="p">The source specification in this case is the URL of one of the nodes in the cluster. The
      backup process will stream data directly from each node in order to create the backup content.
      The initial node is only used to obtain the cluster topology so that the data can be backed
      up.</p>

    <p class="p">A backup created in this way enables you to choose during restoration how you want to restore
      the information. You can choose to restore the entire dataset, or a single bucket, or a
      filtered selection of that information onto a cluster of any size or configuration.</p>

      
    </div>

    
    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Backup all nodes, single bucket</h2>
      <p class="p">To backup all the data for a single bucket, containing all of the information from the
        entire cluster:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">cbbackup http://HOST:8091 /backups/backup-20120501 \

    done
</pre>

      The <samp class="ph codeph">-b</samp> option specifies the name of the bucket that you want to backup. If
      the bucket is a named bucket you will need to provide administrative name and password for
      that bucket. To backup an entire cluster, you will need to run the same operation on each
      bucket within the cluster. </div>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Backup single node, all buckets</h2>
      
      <p class="p">To backup all of the data stored on a single node across all of the different buckets:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">cbbackup http://HOST:8091 /backups/backup-20120501 \
      -u Administrator -p password \
      --single-node
</pre>

      <p class="p">Using this method, the source specification must specify the node that you want backup. To
        backup an entire cluster using this method, you should backup each node individually.</p>

    </div>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Backup single node, single bucket</h2>
      
      <p class="p">To backup the data from a single bucket on a single node:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">cbbackup http://HOST:8091 /backups/backup-20120501 \
      -u Administrator -p password \
      --single-node \
      -b default
</pre>

      <p class="p">Using this method, the source specification must be the node that you want to back up.</p>

    </div>

    
    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Backup single node, single bucket; backup files stored on same node</h2>
      
      <p class="p">To backup a single node and bucket, with the files stored on the same node as the source
        data, there are two methods available. One uses a node specification, the other uses a file
        store specification. Using the node specification:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">ssh USER@HOST
    remote-&gt; sudo su - couchbase
    remote-&gt; cbbackup http://127.0.0.1:8091 /mnt/backup-20120501 \
      -u Administrator -p password \
      --single-node \
      -b default
</pre>

      <p class="p">This method backups up the cluster data of a single bucket on the local node, storing the
        backup data in the local filesystem.</p>

      <p class="p">Using a file store reference (in place of a node reference) is faster because the data
        files can be copied directly from the source directory to the backup directory:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">ssh USER@HOST
    remote-&gt; sudo su - couchbase
    remote-&gt; cbbackup couchstore-files:///opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data/default /mnt/backup-20120501
</pre>

      <p class="p">To backup the entire cluster using this method, you will need to backup each node, and each
        bucket, individually.</p>

      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Choosing the right backup solution depends on your requirements and your
        expected method for restoring the data to the cluster.</div>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Filter keys during backup</h2>
      
      <p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp> command includes support for filtering the keys that are
        backed up into the database files you create. This can be useful if you want to specifically
        backup a portion of your dataset, or you want to move part of your dataset to a different
        bucket.</p>

      <p class="p">The specification is in the form of a regular expression, and is performed on the
        client-side within the <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp> tool. For example, to backup information
        from a bucket where the keys have a prefix of 'object':</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">cbbackup http://HOST:8091 /backups/backup-20120501 \
  -u Administrator -p password \
  -b default \
  -k '^object.*'
</pre>

      <p class="p">The above copies only the keys matching the specified prefix into the backup file. When the
        data is restored, only those keys that were recorded in the backup file will be
        restored.</p>

      <div class="note important"><span class="importanttitle">Important:</span> 
        <p class="p">The regular expression match is performed on the client side. This means that the entire bucket
          contents must be accessed by the <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp> command and then discarded if
          the regular expression does not match.</p>

      </div>

      <p class="p">Key-based regular expressions can also be used when restoring data. You can backup an
        entire bucket and restore selected keys during the restore process using
          <samp class="ph codeph">cbrestore</samp>. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Backup using file copies</h2>
      
      <p class="p">You can also backup by using either <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp> and specifying the local
        directory where the data is stored, or by copying the data files directly using cp, tar, or
        similar.</p>

      <p class="p">For example, using <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp>:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">
&gt; cbbackup \
    couchstore-files:///opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data/default \
    /mnt/backup-20120501
</pre>

      <p class="p">The same backup operation using `cp` :</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">
&gt; cp -R /opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data/default \
      /mnt/copy-20120501
</pre>

      <p class="p">The limitation of backing up information in this way is that the data can only be restored
        to offline nodes in an identical cluster configuration, and where an identical vbucket map
        is in operation (you should also copy the `config.dat` configuration file from each
        node.</p>
