  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Hard failover</h1>

  
  <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Hard failover immediately fails over nodes from clusters.</p>

    <p class="p">During failover, replica vBuckets are promoted to active vBuckets and active vBuckets on the
      failed over node are transitioned to replica vBuckets. After a node is failed over, it can be
      added back to the cluster via delta or full recovery. When a node is added back to the cluster
      after a failover has been performed, the replica vBuckets on the failed over node are
      resynchronized and promoted back to active. Topology changes (such as adding, removing, or
      failing over a server) after a failover, initiates a different type of rebalance operation. </p>

      
      <p class="p">Hard failover is typically used when the node is in a bad state. Auto-failover is a hard failover.
      The following conditions are usually present when hard failover is used:</p>

      
      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">The server node is not healthy.</li>

        <li class="li">Each active vBucket does not have an equivalent replica bucket.</li>

        <li class="li">No replica buckets are present.</li>

      </ul>
