  <title>Online upgrades</title>
  <body>
    <p>You can upgrade your cluster without taking your
      cluster down and so your application keeps running during the upgrade process. There are two
      ways you can perform this process: as a standard online upgrade, or as a swap rebalance. We
      highly recommend using a swap rebalance for online upgrade so that cluster capacity is
      always maintained. The standard online upgrade should only be used if swap rebalance is not
      possible.</p>
    <p>Using the standard online upgrade, you take down one or two nodes from a
        cluster, and rebalance so that remaining nodes handle incoming requests. This is an approach
        you use if you have enough remaining cluster capacity to handle the nodes you remove and
        upgrade. You will need to perform rebalance twice for every node you upgrade: the first time
        to move data onto remaining nodes, and a second time to move data onto the new nodes.
      </p>
    <p>Standard online upgrades can take a while because each node must be taken out of the
        cluster, upgraded to a current version, brought back into the cluster, and then rebalanced.
        However since you can upgrade the cluster without taking the cluster down, you may use
        this upgrade method. </p>
    <p>For swap rebalance, you add a node to the cluster then perform a
          swap rebalance to shift data from an old node to a new node. You might prefer this approach
          if you do not have enough cluster capacity to handle data when you remove an old node. This
          upgrade process is also much quicker than performing a standard online upgrade because you
          only need to rebalance each upgraded node once. </p>
    
    <section><title>Standard online upgrades</title><p>This is also known as a standard online
      upgrade process and it can take place without taking down the cluster or your application.
      This means that the cluster and applications can continue running while you upgrade the
      individual nodes in a cluster to the latest Couchbase version. You should only use this
      online upgrade method if you are not able to perform online upgrade via swap rebalance.</p>
      
      <p>Best practice</p><p> Always add the same number of nodes to a
          cluster as the number that were removed and then perform rebalance. While it is technically
          possible, avoid removing a node, rebalancing, and then adding back nodes into the cluster.
          This reduces cluster capacity until the new node is added back into the cluster, which could
          lead to data being ejected to disk. </p>
      
     
      <p>To perform an standard, online upgrade of your cluster:</p>
      
      <ol>
              <li>Create a backup of your cluster data using <codeph>cbbackup</codeph>.</li>
              <li>Choose a node to remove from the cluster and upgrade. You can upgrade one node at a
                time, or if you have enough cluster capacity, two nodes at a time. We do not recommend
                that you remove more than two nodes at a time for this upgrade.</li>
              <li>In Couchbase Web Console under <uicontrol>Manage Server Nodes</uicontrol> screen, click
                <uicontrol>Remove Server</uicontrol>. This marks the server for removal from the cluster,
                but does not actually remove it.
                  <fig><image href="../images/online-upgrade-removenode.png" width="720"></image></fig></li>
              <li>The <uicontrol>Pending Rebalance</uicontrol> shows servers that require a
          rebalance. Click the <uicontrol>Rebalance</uicontrol> button next to the node you will
          remove. <fig>
            <image href="../images/online-upgrade-rebalance.png" width="720"/>
          </fig>
          <p>This moves data from the node to remaining nodes in cluster. Once rebalancing has been
            completed, the <codeph>Server Nodes</codeph> display should display only the remaining,
            active nodes in your cluster.</p><fig>
            <image href="../images/online-upgrade-noderemoved.png" width="720"/>
          </fig></li>
              <li>Perform an individual node upgrade to the latest version of Couchbase Server.
                <p>Couchbase Server starts automatically after the upgrade. You now need to add the node
                  back to the cluster.</p></li>
              <li>Open Web Console for an existing node in the cluster.</li>
              <li>Navigate to <uicontrol>Manage Server Nodes</uicontrol>.</li>
              <li>Click the <uicontrol>Add Server</uicontrol> button. You will see a prompt to add a node to
                the cluster.
                  <fig><image href="../images/online-upgrade-addnode.png"  width="720"></image></fig>
                <p>After the new node is added, the Pending Rebalance count indicates that servers need to
                  be rebalanced into the cluster.</p></li>
              <li>Click <codeph>Rebalance</codeph> to rebalance the cluster and bring the new node into
                an active state.</li>
            </ol>
      
      <p>Repeat these steps for each node in the cluster in order to upgrade the entire cluster
              to a new
              version.</p>

    <section><title>Online upgrade with swap rebalance</title><p>You can perform a swap rebalance to
      upgrade your nodes to Couchbase Server, without reducing the performance of your cluster.
      This is the preferred method for performing an online upgrade of your cluster because
      cluster capacity is always maintained throughout the upgrade. If you are unable to perform
      an upgrade via swap rebalance, perform a standard online upgrade. </p>
      <p>You will need at least one extra node to perform a swap
            rebalance.</p>
      
      <ol>
              <li>Install Couchbase Server on one extra machine that is not yet in the cluster.</li>
              <li>Create a backup of your cluster data using the <codeph>cbbackup</codeph> tool.</li>
              <li>Open Couchbase Web Console at an existing node in the cluster.</li>
              <li>Go to <uicontrol>Manage-&gt;Server Nodes</uicontrol>. In the Server panel you can view and
                managing servers in the cluster.
                  <fig><image href="../images/upgrade_addserver.png" width="720"></image></fig>
                  </li>
              <li>Click <uicontrol>Add Server</uicontrol>. A panel appears where you can provide credentials and either
                a host name or IP address for the new node.
                  <fig><image href="../images/online-upgrade-addnode.png" width="720"></image></fig>
                  </li>
              <li>Remove one of your existing old nodes from the cluster. Under Server Nodes | Server
                panel, Click Remove Server for the node you want to remove. This will flag this server
                for removal.</li>
              <li>In the Server panel, click Rebalance.
                <p>The rebalance automatically takes all data from the node flagged for removal and move
                  it to your new node.</p></li>
            </ol>
      
      <p>Repeat these steps for all the remaining old nodes in the cluster. You can add and
              remove multiple nodes from a cluster, however you should always add the same number of nodes
              from the cluster as you remove. For instance if you add one node, remove one node and if you
              add two nodes, you can remove two.</p><p/>
    </section>
    
    <section><title>Online upgrade to Enterprise Edition</title>
      <p>Here you remove
      one node from the cluster and rebalance. On the nodes you have taken out of the cluster,
      uninstall Couchbase Server Community Edition package, and install Couchbase Server
      Enterprise Edition. You can then add the new nodes back into the cluster and rebalance.
      Repeat this process until the entire cluster is using the Enterprise Edition.</p>
