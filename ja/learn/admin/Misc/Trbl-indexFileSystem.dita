     <title>Index filesystem structure</title>
     <shortdesc>A description of the index filesystem struction.</shortdesc>
     <body>
          <p>All index files live within a subdirectory of the data directory named
                    <codeph>@indexes</codeph>. Within this subdirectory, there’s a subdirectory for
               each bucket (which matches exactly the bucket name).</p>
          <p>Any index file has the form
                    <codeph>&lt;type&gt;_&lt;hexadecimal_signature&gt;.view.N</codeph> Each
               component’s meaning is:</p>
          <ul>
               <li><p><codeph>type</codeph> - the index type, can be main (active vbuckets data) or
                         replica (replica vbuckets data)</p></li>
               <li><p><codeph>hexadecimal_signature</codeph> - this is the hexadecimal form of an
                         MD5 hash computed over the map/reduce functions of a design document, when
                         these functions change, a new index is created. It’s possible to have
                         multiple versions of the same design document alive (different signatures).
                         This happens for a short period, for example a client does a
                              <codeph>stale=false</codeph> request to an index (1 index == 1 design
                         document), which triggers an index build/update and before this
                         update/build finishes, the design document is updated (with different
                         map/reduce functions). The initial version of the index will remain alive
                         until all currently blocked clients on it are served. In the meanwhile new
                         query requests are redirected to the latest (second) version of the index,
                         always. This is what makes it possible to have multiple versions of the
                         same design document index files at any point in time (however for short
                         periods).</p></li>
               <li><p><codeph>N</codeph> - when an index file is created N is 1, always. Every time
                         the index file is compacted, N is incremented by 1. This is similar to what
                         happens for vbucket database files Data missing in query response or it’s wrong 
                         (potentially due to server issues)).</p></li>
          </ul>
          <p>For each design document, there’s also a subdirectory named like
                    <codeph>tmp_&lt;hexadecimal_signature&gt;_&lt;type&gt;</codeph>. This is a
               directory containing temporary files used for the initial index build (and soon for
               incremental optimizations). Files within this directory have a name formed by the
               design document signature and a generated UUID. These files are periodically deleted
               when they’re not useful anymore.</p>
          <p>All views defined within a design document are backed by a btree data structure, and
               they all live inside the same index file. Therefore for each design document,
               independently of the number of views it defines, there’s 2 files, one for main data
               and the other for replica data.</p>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <codeblock><codeph>&gt; tree couch/0/\@indexes/
