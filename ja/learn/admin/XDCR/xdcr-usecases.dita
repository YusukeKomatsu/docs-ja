with little or no warning. With active-active cross datacenter replication in
Couchbase Server, applications can read and write to any geo-location ensuring
availability of data 24x365 even if an entire datacenter goes down.</p><p><b>Bringing Data Closer to Users.</b> Interactive web applications demand low
latency response times to deliver an awesome application experience. The best
way to reduce latency is to bring relevant data closer to the user. For example,
in online advertising, sub-millisecond latency is needed to make optimized
decisions about real-time ad placements. XDCR can be used to bring
post-processed user profile data closer to the user for low latency data access.</p><p><b>Data Replication for Development and Test Needs.</b> Developers and testers
often need to simulate production-like environments for troubleshooting or to
produce a more reliable test. By using cross datacenter replication, you can
create test clusters that host subset of your production data so that you can
test code changes without interrupting production processing or risking data
loss.</p></body></topic>
