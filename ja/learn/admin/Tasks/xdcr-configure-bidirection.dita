    <title>Configuring bi-directional replication</title>
    <shortdesc/>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>Replication is unidirectional from one cluster to another. To configure bidirectional
                replication between two clusters, provide settings for two separate replication
                streams. One stream replicates changes from Cluster A to Cluster B, another stream
                replicates changes from Cluster B to Cluster A. </p>
                
                <note type="note">You do not need identical topologies for both clusters. You can have a different number
                    of nodes in each cluster, RAM configuration, and persistence configuration.</note>
                
                <p>To configure a bi-directional replication:</p>

            <step>
                <cmd>Create a replication from Cluster A to Cluster B on Cluster A.</cmd>

                <cmd>Create a replication from Cluster B to Cluster A on Cluster B.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Configure the number of parallel replicators that run per node. The default number of
                    parallel, active streams per node is 32 and is adjustable.</cmd>
