  <title>Hard failover</title>
  <shortdesc>Hard failover immediately fails over nodes from clusters.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>During failover, replica vBuckets are promoted to active vBuckets and active vBuckets on the
      failed over node are transitioned to replica vBuckets. After a node is failed over, it can be
      added back to the cluster via delta or full recovery. When a node is added back to the cluster
      after a failover has been performed, the replica vBuckets on the failed over node are
      resynchronized and promoted back to active. Topology changes (such as adding, removing, or
      failing over a server) after a failover, initiates a different type of rebalance operation. </p>
      
      <p>Hard failover is typically used when the node is in a bad state. Auto-failover is a hard failover.
      The following conditions are usually present when hard failover is used:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The server node is not healthy.</li>
        <li>Each active vBucket does not have an equivalent replica bucket.</li>
        <li>No replica buckets are present.</li>
      </ul>
