 <title>General tips</title>
 <shortdesc>General tips include various initial diagnostics activities.</shortdesc>
 <body>
  <p>The following are some general tips that may be useful before performing any more detailed
   investigations:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><p>Try pinging the node.</p></li>
   <li><p>Try connecting to Couchbase Server Web Console on the node.</p></li>
   <li><p>Try to use telnet to connect to the
      various ports that Couchbase Server uses.</p></li>
   <li><p>Try reloading the web page.</p></li>
   <li><p>Check firewall settings (if any) on the node. Make sure there isn’t a firewall between you
     and the node. On a Windows system, for example, the Windows firewall might be blocking the
     ports (Control Panel &gt; Windows Firewall).</p></li>
   <li><p>Make sure that the documented ports are open between nodes and make sure the data
     operation ports are available to clients.</p></li>
   <li><p>Check your browser’s security settings.</p></li>
   <li><p>Check any other security software installed on your system, such as antivirus
     programs.</p></li>
   <li><p>Generate a Diagnostic Report for use by Couchbase Technical Support to help determine what
     the problem is. There are two ways of collecting this information:</p>
    <ul>
     <li><p>Click <codeph>Generate Diagnostic Report</codeph> on the Log page to obtain a snapshot
       of your system’s configuration and log information for deeper analysis. You must send this
       file to Couchbase.</p></li>
     <li><p>Run the <codeph>cbcollect_info</codeph> on each node within your cluster. To run, you
       must specify the name of the file to be generated:</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><codeph> &gt; cbcollect_info nodename.zip </codeph></p>
    <p>This will create a Zip file with the specified name. You must run each command individually
     on each node within the cluster. You can then send each file to Couchbase for analysis.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
