  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Tuning XDCR performance</h1>

  
  <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">XDCR performance can be tuned via the Web console or the REST XDCR advanced
    settings.</p>

      
      <p class="p"> By default, XDCR
        gets metadata twice for documents over 256 bytes before it performs conflict resolution for at a
        destination cluster. If the document fails conflict resolution it will be discarded at the
        destination cluster.</p>

      
      <p class="p">When a document is smaller than the number of bytes provided as this
        parameter, XDCR immediately puts it into the replication queue without getting metadata on the
        source cluster. If the document is deleted on a source cluster, XDCR will no longer fetch
        metadata for the document before it sends this update to a destination cluster. Once a document
        reaches the destination cluster, XDCR will fetch the metadata and perform conflict resolution
        between documents. If the document ‘loses’ conflict resolution, Couchbase Server discards it on
        the destination cluster and keeps the version on the destination. This new feature improves
        replication latency, particularly when you replicate small documents.</p>

      
      <p class="p">There are tradeoffs
        when you change this setting. If you set this low relative to document size, XDCR will
        frequently check metadata. This will increase latency during replication, it also means that it
        will get metadata before it puts a document into the replication queue, and will get it again
        for the destination to perform conflict resolution. The advantage is that you do not waste
        network bandwidth since XDCR will send less documents that will ‘lose.’</p>

      
      <p class="p">If you set this
        very high relative to document size, XDCR fetches less metadata which will improve latency
        during replication. This also means that you will increase the rate at which XDCR puts items
        immediately into the replication queue which can potentially overwhelm your network, especially
        if you set a high number of parallel replicators. This may increase the number of documents sent
        by XDCR which ultimately ‘lose’ conflicts at the destination which wastes network
        bandwidth.</p>

      
      <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> DCR does not fetch metadata for documents that are
        deleted.</div>

      
      <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Changing the document threshold</h2>
        
        <p class="p">Change the document threshold with the REST <samp class="ph codeph">/settings/replications
          optimisticReplicationThreshold</samp> URI and parameter for XDCR advanced settings.
        Alternatively, change the <span class="ph uicontrol">XDCR Optimistic Replication Threshold</span> setting for 
          the XDCR replication.</p>

      </div>

      
      
      <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Monitoring optimistic replication</h2>
      <p class="p">The easiest way you can monitor the impact of this setting is in Couchbase Web console. On
        the Data Buckets tab under Incoming XDCR Operations, you can compare <samp class="ph codeph">metadata reads
          per sec</samp> to <samp class="ph codeph">sets per sec</samp>. </p>

      <img class="image" src="../images/monitor_optmized_xdcr.png">
      <p class="p">If you set a low threshold relative to document size, <samp class="ph codeph">metadata reads per
          sec</samp> will be roughly twice the value of <samp class="ph codeph">sets per sec</samp>. If you set
        a high threshold relative to document size, this will virtually eliminate the first fetch of
        metadata and therefore <samp class="ph codeph">metadata reads per sec</samp> will roughly equal
          <samp class="ph codeph">sets per sec</samp></p>

      <p class="p">The other option is to check the log files for XDCR, which you can find in
          <samp class="ph codeph">/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/logs</samp> on the nodes for a source bucket.
        The log files following the naming convention <samp class="ph codeph">xdcr.1</samp>,
          <samp class="ph codeph">xdcr.2</samp> and so on. In the logs you will see a series of entries as
        follows:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">
out of all 11 docs, number of small docs (including dels: 2) is 4,
number of big docs is 7, threshold is 256 bytes,
after conflict resolution at target ("http://Administrator:asdasd@127.0.0.1:9501/default%2f3%3ba19c9d4e733a97fa7cb38daa4113d034/"),
out of all big 7 docs the number of docs we need to replicate is: 5;
total # of docs to be replicated is: 9, total latency: 142 ms
</pre>

      <p class="p">The first line means that 4 documents are under the threshold and XDCR checked metadata
        twice for all 7 documents and replicated 5 larger documents and 4 smaller documents. The
        amount of time to check and replicate all 11 documents was 142 milliseconds.</p>
