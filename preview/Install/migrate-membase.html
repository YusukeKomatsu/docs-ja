  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Migrating from Membase</h1>

  <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Migration guidelines for Membase users.</p>


      <p class="p">For an existing Membase user, the primary methods for creating, adding, manipulating, and
      retrieving data remain the same. In addition, the background operational elements of the
      Couchbase Server deployment will not differ from the basic running of a Membase cluster.</p>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Term and concept differences</h2>The following terms are new or updated in
      Couchbase Server: <dl class="dl">
        
          <dt class="dt dlterm">Views</dt>

          <dd class="dd">Views and the associated terms of the <samp class="ph codeph">map</samp> and <samp class="ph codeph">reduce</samp>
            functions used to define views. Views provide an alternative method for accessing and
            querying information stored in key-value pairs within the Couchbase Server. Views allow
            you to query and retrieve information based on the values of the contents of a key-value
            pair, provided the information has been stored in a JSON format.</dd>

        
      </dl>
<dl class="dl">
        
          <dt class="dt dlterm">JSON</dt>

          <dd class="dd">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data representation format that is required to
            store the information in a format that can be parsed by the View system.</dd>

        
      </dl>
<dl class="dl">
        
          <dt class="dt dlterm">Membase Server</dt>

          <dd class="dd">This is now the Couchbase Server.</dd>

        
      </dl>
<dl class="dl">
        
          <dt class="dt dlterm">Membase buckets</dt>

          <dd class="dd">These are now the Couchbase buckets</dd>

        
      </dl>
</div>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Consistent functionality</h2>
      <p class="p">The core functionality of
      Membase, including the methods for basic creation, updating, and retrieval of information
      all remain identical within Couchbase Server. You can continue to use the same client
      protocols for setting and retrieving information.</p>
<p class="p">The administration, deployment,
        and core of the Couchbase Web Console and administration interfaces are also identical. There are
        updates and improvements to support additional functionality which is included in existing
        tools. These include views-related statistics, and an update to the Web Administration
        Console for building and defining views.</p>
</div>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Changed functionality</h2>
      <p class="p">The main difference available in the Couchbase Server is that, in addition to the key-value
        data store nature of the database, you can also use views to convert the information from
        individual objects in your database into lists or tables of records and information. Through
        the view system, you can also query data from the database based on the value (or fragment
        of a value) of the information that you have stored against a key.</p>
<p class="p">This fundamental
        differences means that applications no longer need to manually manage the concept of lists
        or sets of data by using other keys as a lookup or compounding
        values.</p>
</div>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Operational and deployment differences</h2>
      <p class="p">The main components of the operation and deployment of your Couchbase Server remain the
        same as with the Membase Server. You can add new nodes, fail over, rebalance and otherwise
        manage your nodes.</p>
<p class="p">However, the introduction of views means that you need to
        monitor and control the design documents and views that are created alongside your bucket
        configurations. Indexes are generated for each design document (that is multiple views), and
        for optimum reliability you might want to back up the generated index information to reduce
        the time to bring up a node in the event of a failure, as building a view from raw data on
        large datasets can take a significant amount of time.</p>
<p class="p">In addition, you need to
          understand how to recreate and rebuild view data, and how to compact and clean up view
          information to help reduce disk space consumption and response
          times.</p>
</div>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Client and application changes</h2>
      <p class="p">Clients can continue to communicate with the Couchbase Server using the existing memcached
        protocol interface for the basic create, retrieve, update and delete operations for
        key-value pairs. However, to access the view functionality you must use a client library
        that supports the view API (which uses HTTP REST).</p>

      <p class="p">To build views that can output and query your stored data, your objects must be stored in
        the database in the JSON format. If you have been using the native serialization of your
        client library to convert a language specific object so that it can be stored into the
       Membase Server, you might need to structure your data and use a native to JSON serialization
        solution, or reformat your data so that it can be formatted as JSON.</p>
