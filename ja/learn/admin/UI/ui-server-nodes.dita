  <title>Server Nodes</title>
  <shortdesc>The <uicontrol>Server Nodes</uicontrol> section shows statistics across the server nodes in the cluster.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>In addition to monitoring buckets over all the nodes within the cluster, Couchbase Server
      also includes support for monitoring the statistics for an individual node.</p>
    <p>The Server Nodes monitoring overview shows summary data for the Swap Usage, RAM Usage, CPU
      Usage and Active Items across all the nodes in your cluster.</p>

        </image>

    <p>Clicking the triangle next to a server displays server node specific information, including
      the IP address, OS, Couchbase version and Memory and Disk allocation information.</p>
    
      <image href="../images/web-console-server-node.png" width="720">
        </image>

    <p>The detail display shows the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Node information</b>
      <ul>
      <li>Server Name - The server IP address and port number used to communicated with this sever.</li>
      <li>Uptime - The uptime of the Couchbase Server process. This displays how long Couchbase
  Server has been running as a node, not the uptime for the server.</li>
      <li>OS - The operating system identifier, showing the platform, environment, operating
  system and operating system derivative.</li>
      <li>Version - The version number of Couchbase Server installed and running on this node.</li>
      </ul></li>
    <li><b>Memory cache</b>
        <p>The Memory Cache section shows you the information about memory usage, both for Couchbase
          Server and for the server as a whole. You can use this to compare RAM usage within
          Couchbase Server to the overall available RAM. The specific details tracked are:</p><ul>
          <li>Couchbase Quota - Shows the amount of RAM in the server allocated specifically to
            Couchbase Server.</li>
          <li>In Use - Shows the amount of RAM currently in use by stored data by Couchbase
            Server.</li>
          <li>Other Data - Shows the RAM used by other processes on the server.</li>
          <li>Free - Shows the amount of free RAM out of the total RAM available on the server.</li>
          <li>Total - Shows the total amount of free RAM on the server available for all
            processes.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>Disk Storage</b>
        <p>This section displays the amount of disk storage available and configured for Couchbase.
          Information will be displayed for each configured disk.</p><ul>
          <li>In Use - Shows the amount of disk space currently used to stored data for Couchbase
            Server.</li>
          <li>Other Data - Shows the disk space used by other files on the configured device, not
            controlled by Couchbase Server.</li>
          <li>Free - Shows the amount of free disk storage on the server out of the total disk space
            available.</li>
          <li>Total - Shows the total disk size for the configured storage device.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <p>Selecting a server from the list shows the server-specific version of the Bucket Monitoring
      overview, showing server-specific performance information.</p>
    
    <image href="../images/web-console-server-individual.png" width="720">
        </image>
    <p>The graphs specific to the server are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>swap usage</b> - Amount of swap space in use on this server.</li>
      <li><b>free RAM</b> - Amount of RAM available on this server.</li>
      <li><b>CPU utilization</b> - Percentage of CPU utilized across all cores on the selected server.</li>
      <li><b>connection count</b> - Number of connections to this server of all types for client, proxy, TAP requests and
      internal statistics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By clicking on the blue triangle against an individual statistic within the server monitoring
      display, you can optionally select to view the information for a specific bucket-statistic on
      an individual server, instead of across the entire cluster.</p>

    <section><title>Understanding server states</title><p>Couchbase Server nodes can be in a number
        of different states depending on their current activity and availability. The displayed
        states are:</p><ul>
        <li><b>Up</b><p>Host is up, replicating data between nodes and servicing requests from clients.</p></li>
        <li><b>Down</b><p>Host is down, not replicating data between nodes and not servicing requests from
        clients.</p>    
      <image href="../images/web-console-server-states-down.png" width="720"></image></li>
        <li><b>Pend</b>
      <p>Host is up and currently filling RAM with data, but is not servicing requests from
        clients. Client access will be supported once the RAM has been pre-filled with
        information.</p>
      <image href="../images/web-console-server-states-pend.png" width="720"></image></li>
        </ul>
          
      <p>You can monitor the current server status using both the <codeph>Manage:
          Server Nodes</codeph> and <codeph>Monitor: Server Nodes</codeph> screens within the Web
        Console.</p></section>
