  <shortdesc>Timeout errors when querying a view with <codeph>stale=false.</codeph></shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>When querying a view with <codeph>stale=false</codeph>, you get often timeout errors for one
      or more nodes. These nodes are nodes that did not receive the original query request, for
      example you query node 1, and you get timeout errors for nodes 2, 3 and 4 as in the example
      below (view with reduce function _count):</p>
    <codeblock><codeph>&gt; curl -s 'http://localhost:9500/default/_design/dev_test2/_view/view2?full_set=true&amp;stale=false'
{"rows":[
  {"key":null,"value":125184}
],
"errors":[
  {"from":"http://192.168.1.80:9503/_view_merge/?stale=false","reason":"timeout"},
  {"from":"http://192.168.1.80:9501/_view_merge/?stale=false","reason":"timeout"},
  {"from":"http://192.168.1.80:9502/_view_merge/?stale=false","reason":"timeout"}
]
}
</codeph></codeblock>
    <p>The problem here is that by default, for queries with <codeph>stale=false</codeph> (full
      consistency), the view merging node (node which receive the query request, node 1 in this
      example) waits up to 60000 milliseconds (1 minute) to receive partial view results from each
      other node in the cluster. If it waits for more than 1 minute for results from a remote node,
      it stops waiting for results from that node and a timeout error entry is added to the final
      response. A <codeph>stale=false</codeph> request blocks a client, or the view merger node as
      in this example, until the index is up to date, so these timeouts can happen frequently.</p>
    <p>If you look at the logs from those nodes you got a timeout error, you’ll see the index
      build/update took more than 60 seconds, example from node 2:</p>
    <codeblock><codeph>[couchdb:info,2012-08-20T15:21:13.150,n_1@192.168.1.80:&lt;0.6234.0&gt;:couch_log:info:39] Set view

</codeph></codeblock>
    <p>In this case, node 2 took 103.774 seconds to update the index.</p>
    <p>In order to avoid those timeouts, you can pass a large connection_timeout in the view query
      URL, example:</p>
    <codeblock><codeph>&gt; time curl -s
 'http://localhost:9500/default/_design/dev_test2/_view/view2?full_set=true&amp;stale=false&amp;connection_timeout=999999999'
{"rows":[
{"key":null,"value":2000000}
]
}
real  2m44.867s
user   0m0.007s
sys    0m0.007s
</codeph></codeblock>
    <p>And in the logs of nodes 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively you’ll see something like this:</p>
    <p><codeph>node 1, view merger node</codeph></p>
