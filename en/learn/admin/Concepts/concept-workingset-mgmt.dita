 <title>Working set management and ejection</title>
 <shortdesc>Working set management is the process of freeing up space and ensuring that the most
  used items are available in RAM. Ejection is the process of removing data from RAM to provide room
  for frequently used items. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p> The process that Couchbase Server performs to free space in RAM, and to ensure the most-used
   items are still available in RAM is also known as working set management. Ejection is the process
   of removing data from RAM to provide room for frequently-used items. Ejections is automatically
   performed by Couchbase Server. When Couchbase Server ejects information, it works in conjunction
   with the disk persistence system to ensure that data in RAM has been persisted to disk and can be
   safely retrieved back into RAM if the item is requested. </p>
  <p> In addition to memory quota for the caching layer, there are two watermarks the engine uses to
   determine when it is necessary to start persisting more data to disk. These are <codeph>mem_low_wat</codeph> and
   <codeph>mem_high_wat</codeph>. </p>
  <p> As the caching layer becomes full of data, eventually the mem_low_wat is passed. At this time,
   no action is taken. As data continues to load, it eventually reaches mem_high_wat. At this point,
   a background job is scheduled to ensure items are migrated to disk and that memory is available
   for other Couchbase Server items. This job runs until measured memory reaches mem_low_wat. If the
   rate of incoming items is faster than the migration of items to disk, the system can return
   errors indicating there is not enough space. This continues until there is available memory. The
   process of removing data from the caching to make way for the actively used information is called
   ejection and is controlled automatically through thresholds set on each configured bucket in the
   Couchbase Server cluster. </p>

   <title>Working set management process</title>
   <p>Couchbase Server actively manages the data stored in a caching layer; this includes the
    information which is frequently accessed by clients and which needs to be available for rapid
    reads and writes. When there are too many items in RAM, Couchbase Server removes certain data to
    create free space and to maintain system performance. This process is called “working set
    management” and the set of data in RAM is referred to as the “working set”.</p>
   <p>In general the working set consists of all the keys, metadata, and associated documents which
    are frequently used require fast access. The process the server performs to remove data from RAM
    is known as ejection. When the server performs this process, it removes the document, but not
    the keys or metadata for the item. Keeping keys and metadata in RAM serves three important
    purposes in a system:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p>Couchbase Server uses the remaining key and metadata in RAM if a request for that key comes
      from a client. If a request occurs, the server then tries to fetch the item from disk and
      return it into RAM.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>The server can also use the keys and metadata in RAM for “miss access”. This means that it
      is quickly determine whether an item is missing and if so, perform some action, such as add
      it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>Finally, the expiration process in Couchbase Server uses the metadata in RAM to quickly scan
      for items that are expired and later remove them from disk. This process is known as the
      “expiry pager” and runs every 60 minutes by default. </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>Not Frequently Used (NFU) items</title>
   <p>All items in the server contain metadata indicating whether the item has been recently
    accessed or not. This metadata is known as not-recently-used (NRU). If an item has not been
    recently used, then the item is a candidate for ejection if the high water mark has been
    exceeded. When the high water mark has been exceeded, the server evicts items from RAM.</p>
   <p>Couchbase Server provides two NRU bits per item and also provides a replication protocol that
    can propagate items that are frequently read, but not mutated often. </p>
   <p>For earlier versions, Couchbase Server provided only a single bit for NRU and a different
    replication protocol which resulted in two issues: metadata could not reflect how frequently or
    recently an item had been changed, and the replication protocol only propagated NRUs for
    mutation items from an active vBucket to a replica vBucket. This second behavior meant that the
    working set on an active vBucket could be quite different than the set on a replica vBucket. By
    changing the replication protocol, the working set in replica vBuckets will be closer to the
    working set in the active vBucket.</p>
   <p>NRUs are decremented or incremented by server processes to indicate an item is more frequently
    used, or less frequently used. Items with lower bit values have lower scores and are considered
    more frequently used. The bit values, corresponding scores and status are as follows:</p>

   <p>There are two processes which change the NRU for an item: </p>
   <ul>
    <li>A client reads or writes an item, the server decrements NRU and lowers the item’s score</li>
    <li>A daily process which creates a list of frequently-used items in RAM. After this process
     runs, the server increments one of the NRU bits.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Because the two processes changes NRUs, they also affect which items are candidates for
    ejection.</p>
   <p>Couchbase Server settings can be adjusted to change behavior during ejection. For example,
    specify the percentage of RAM to be consume before items are ejected or specify whether ejection
    should occur more frequently on replicated data than on original data. Couchbase recommends that
    the default settings be used.</p>

   <title>Understanding the item pager</title>
   <p>The item pager process, which runs periodically, removes documents from RAM and retains the
    item’s key and metadata. If the amount of RAM used by items reaches the high water mark (upper
    threshold), both active and replica data are ejected until the memory usage (amount of RAM
    consumed) reaches the low water mark (lower threshold). Evictions of active and replica data
    occur with the ratio probability of 40% (active data) to 60% (replica data) until the memory
    usage reaches the low watermark. Both the high water mark and low water mark are expressed as a
    percentage amount of RAM, such as 80%.</p>
   <p>Both the high water mark and low water mark can be changed by providing a percentage amount of
    RAM for a node, for example, 80%. Couchbase recommends that the following default settings be
    used:</p>

   <p>The item pager ejects items from RAM in two phases:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <p><b>Phase 1: Eject based on NRU</b>. Scan NRU for items and create list of all items with
      score of 3. Eject all items with a NRU score of 3. Check RAM usage and repeat this process if
      usage is still above the low water mark.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p><b>Phase 2: Eject based on Algorithm</b>. Increment all item NRUs by 1. If an NRU is equal
      to 3, generate a random number and eject that item if the random number is greater than a
      specified probability. The probability is based on current memory usage, low water mark, and
      whether a vBucket is in an active or replica state. If a vBucket is in active state the
      probability of ejection is lower than if the vBucket is in a replica state. The default
      probabilities for ejection from active of replica vBuckets is as follows:</p>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>The following is the probability of ejection based on active vs. replica vBuckets:</p>
