  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Restoring with <samp class="ph codeph">cbrestore</samp></h1>

  
  <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">To restore bucket data that was backed up using the command <span class="keyword cmdname">cbbackup</span>, 
    use the command <span class="keyword cmdname">cbrestore</span> to restore information into a bucket on a new cluster. </p>


    
    <p class="p"> When restoring a backup, you have to select the appropriate restore sequence
    based on the type of restore you are performing. The available methods 
    when restoring a cluster depend on the method you used when backing up
    the cluster. </p>

    
    <p class="p">If <span class="keyword cmdname">cbbackup</span> was used to backup the bucket data, you can restore
    back to a cluster with the same or different configuration. This is because
      <span class="keyword cmdname">cbbackup</span> stores information about the stored bucket data in a format that
    enables it to be restored back into a bucket on a new cluster. </p>

    
    <div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If the information was backed up using a direct file copy, then you must restore
    the information back to an identical cluster.</div>


    
    <p class="p">The <span class="keyword cmdname">cbrestore</span> command takes the information that has been backed up via the
      <span class="keyword cmdname">cbbackup</span>&gt; command and streams the stored data into a cluster. The configuration
    of the cluster does not have to match the cluster configuration when the data
    was backed up, allowing it to be used when transferring information to a new
    cluster or updated or expanded version of the existing cluster in the event of
    disaster recovery.</p>

    
    <p class="p">Because the data can be restored flexibly, it provides for a number of different
    scenarios to be executed on the data that has been backed up:</p>

    
    <ul class="ul">
      <li class="li">Restoring data into a cluster of a different size and configuration.</li>

      <li class="li">Transferring or restoring data into a different bucket on the same or
        different cluster.</li>

      <li class="li">Restoring a selected portion of the data into a new or different
        cluster, or the same cluster but a different bucket.</li>

    </ul>


    
    <p class="p">The basic format of the <span class="keyword cmdname">cbrestore</span> command is as follows:</p>


<pre class="pre codeblock">cbrestore [options] [source] [destination]
</pre>

    
    <p class="p">Where:</p>

    <dl class="dl">
      
        <dt class="dt dlterm">[options]</dt>

        <dd class="dd">Options specifying how the information should be restored into the cluster. Common options include:
          <ul class="ul">
            <li class="li">--bucket-source
              <p class="p">Specify the name of the bucket data to be read from the backup data that will be
                restored.</p>
</li>

            <li class="li">--bucket-destination
              <p class="p">Specify the name of the bucket the data will be written to. If this option is
                not specified, the data will be written to a bucket with the same name as the
                source bucket.</p>
</li>

            <li class="li">--add
              <p class="p">Use <samp class="ph codeph">--add</samp> instead of <samp class="ph codeph">--set</samp> in order to not overwrite existing items in the destination.</p>
</li>

          </ul>
</dd>

      
    </dl>

    <dl class="dl">
      
        <dt class="dt dlterm">[source]</dt>

        <dd class="dd">The backup directory specified to <samp class="ph codeph">cbbackup</samp> where the backup data was stored.</dd>

      
    </dl>

    <dl class="dl">
      
        <dt class="dt dlterm">[destination]</dt>

        <dd class="dd">The REST API URL of a node within the cluster where the information will be
          restored.</dd>

      
    </dl>

   
    
    <p class="p">The <span class="keyword cmdname">cbrestore</span> command restores only a single bucket of data at a time. If you
    have created a backup of an entire cluster (such as all buckets), then you must
    restore each bucket individually back to the cluster. All destination buckets
    must already exist since <span class="keyword cmdname">cbrestore</span> does not create or configure destination buckets
    for you.</p>

    
    <p class="p">For example, to restore a single bucket of data to a cluster:</p>

    
    
<pre class="pre codeblock">cbrestore \
    /backups/backup-2012-05-10 \

</pre>

    
    <p class="p">To restore the bucket data to a different bucket on the cluster:</p>

    
    
<pre class="pre codeblock">cbrestore \

    <p class="p">The <samp class="ph codeph">msg</samp> count in this case is the number of documents restored back to the
    bucket in the cluster.</p>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Filtering keys during restore</h2>
