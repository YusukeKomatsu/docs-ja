 <title>Tombstone purging</title>
 <shortdesc>Tombstones are records of expired or deleted items that include item keys and metadata.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Couchbase Server and other distributed databases
    maintain tombstones in order to provide eventual consistency between nodes and between
    clusters. Tombstones are records of expired or deleted items and they include the key for
    the item and metadata. Couchbase Server stores the key plus several bytes of metadata
    per deleted item in two structures per node. With millions of mutations, the space taken up
    by tombstones can grow quickly. This is especially the case if there are a large number of
    deletions or expired documents.</p>
    
    <p>The Metadata Purge Interval sets how frequently a node permanently purges metadata on deleted and expired
     items. The Metadata Purge Interval setting runs as part of auto-compaction. This helps reduce the storage
     requirement by roughly 3x times lower than before and also frees up space much faster.</p>
