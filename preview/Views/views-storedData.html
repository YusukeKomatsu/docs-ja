  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Views and stored data</h1>

  
  <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">This section describes how the views system relates to stored data.</p>

    <p class="p">The view system relies on the information stored within your cluster being formatted as a
      JSON document. The formatting of the data in this form enable the individual fields of the
      data to be identified and used at the components of the index.</p>

    <p class="p">Information is stored into your Couchbase database the data stored is parsed, if the
      information can be identified as valid JSON then the information is tagged and identified in
      the database as valid JSON. If the information cannot be parsed as valid JSON then it is
      stored as a verbatim binary copy of the submitted data.</p>

    
    <div class="fig fignone"><img class="image" src="../images/view-types-datastore.png" width="600"></div>

    
    <p class="p">When retrieving the stored data, the format of the information depends on whether the data
      was tagged as valid JSON or not:</p>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">JSON information</h2>
    
    <p class="p">Information identified as JSON data may not be returned in a format identical to that stored.
      The information will be semantically identical, in that the same fields, data and structure as
      submitted will be returned. Metadata information about the document is presented in a separate
      structure available during view processing.</p>

    <p class="p">The white space, field ordering may differ from the submitted version of the JSON
      document.</p>

    <p class="p">For example, the JSON document below, stored using the key <samp class="ph codeph">mykey</samp> :</p>


    <pre class="pre codeblock">
{
   "title" : "Fish Stew",
   "servings" : 4,
   "subtitle" : "Delicious with fresh bread"
}
</pre>


    <p class="p">May be returned within the view processor as:</p>

    <pre class="pre codeblock">
{
    "servings": 4,
    "subtitle": "Delicious with fresh bread",
    "title": "Fish Stew"
}
    </pre>

    </div>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Non-JSON information</h2>
    
    <p class="p">Information not parsable as JSON will always be stored and returned as a binary copy of the
      information submitted to the database. If you store an image, for example, the data returned
      will be an identical binary copy of the stored image.</p>

    <p class="p">Non-JSON data is available as a base64 string during view processing. A non-JSON document can
      be identified by examining the <samp class="ph codeph">type</samp> field of the metadata structure.</p>

    <p class="p">The significance of the returned structure can be seen when editing the view within the Web
      Console.</p>

    </div>

    
    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">JSON basics</h2>
      <p class="p">JSON is used because it is a lightweight, easily parsed,
        cross-platform data representation format. There are a multitude of libraries and tools
        designed to help developers work efficiently with data represented in JSON format, on every
        platform and every conceivable language and application framework, including, of course,
        most web browsers.</p>

      <p class="p">JSON supports the same basic types as supported by JavaScript,
        these are:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">Number (either integer or floating-point).</li>

      </ul>
<p class="p">JavaScript supports a maximum numerical value of 2<sup class="ph sup">53</sup>. If you are working
        with numbers larger than this from within your client library environment (for example,
        64-bit numbers), you must store the value as a string.</p>
<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><p class="p">String — this should be enclosed by double-quotes and supports Unicode characters and
            backslash escaping. For example:</p>

          <pre class="pre codeblock">"A String"</pre>
</li>

        <li class="li"><p class="p">Boolean — a <samp class="ph codeph">true</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">false</samp> value. You can use these
            strings directly. For example:</p>
<samp class="ph codeph">{ "value": true}</samp></li>

        <li class="li"><p class="p">Array — a list of values enclosed in square brackets. For example:</p>

          <samp class="ph codeph">["one", "two", "three"]</samp></li>

        <li class="li"><p class="p">Object — a set of key/value pairs (i.e. an associative array, or hash). The key must
            be a string, but the value can be any of the supported JSON values. For example:</p>

          <pre class="pre codeblock">{
   "servings" : 4,
   "subtitle" : "Easy to make in advance, and then cook when ready",
   "cooktime" : 60,
   "title" : "Chicken Coriander"
}
</pre>
</li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p">If the submitted data cannot be parsed as a JSON, the information will be stored as a
        binary object, not a JSON document.</p>
</div>

    
    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Document metadata</h2>
      <p class="p">During view processing, metadata about individual
        documents is exposed through a separate JSON object, <samp class="ph codeph">meta</samp>, that can be
        optionally defined as the second argument to the <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp>. This metadata can
        be used to further identify and qualify the document being processed.</p>

      <p class="p">The
          <samp class="ph codeph">meta</samp> structure contains the following fields and associated
        information:</p>

      <ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">id</samp></li>

      </ul>
<p class="p">The ID or key of the stored data object. This is the same as the key used when writing
        the object to the Couchbase database.</p>
<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">rev</samp></li>

      </ul>
<p class="p">An internal revision ID used internally to track the current revision of the
        information. The information contained within this field is not consistent or trackable and
        should not be used in client applications.</p>
<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">type</samp></li>

      </ul>
<p class="p">The type of the data that has been stored. A valid JSON document will have the type
          <samp class="ph codeph">json</samp>. Documents identified as binary data will have the type
          <samp class="ph codeph">base64</samp>.</p>
<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">flags</samp></li>

      </ul>
<p class="p">The numerical value of the flags set when the data was stored. The availability and
        value of the flags is dependent on the client library you are using to store your data.
        Internally the flags are stored as a 32-bit integer.</p>
<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><samp class="ph codeph">expiration</samp></li>

      </ul>

      <p class="p">The expiration value for the stored object. The stored expiration time is always
        stored as an absolute Unix epoch time value.</p>
<p class="p">These additional fields are only exposed
        when processing the documents within the view server. These fields are not returned when you
        access the object through the Memcached/Couchbase protocol as part of the
        document.</p>

    </div>

    
    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Non-JSON data</h2><p class="p">All documents stored in Couchbase Server will return a
        JSON structure, however, only submitted information that could be parsed into a JSON
        document will be stored as a JSON document. If you store a value that cannot be parsed as a
        JSON document, the original binary data is stored. This can be identified during view
        processing by using the <samp class="ph codeph">meta</samp> object supplied to the <samp class="ph codeph">map()</samp>
        function.</p>
<p class="p">Information that has been identified and stored as binary documents instead
        of JSON documents can still be indexed through the views system by creating an index on the
        key data. This can be particularly useful when the document key is significant. For example,
        if you store information using a prefix to the key to identify the record type, you can
        create document-type specific indexes.</p>
</div>

    
    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Document storage and indexing sequence</h2><p class="p">The method of storage of
        information into the Couchbase Server affects how and when the indexing information is
        built, and when data written to the cluster is incorporated into the indexes. In addition,
        the indexing of data is also affected by the view system and the settings used when the view
        is accessed.</p>

      
      
      
      
      <p class="p">The basic storage and indexing sequence is:</p>

      
      
      
      <ol class="ol">
        <li class="li">A document is stored within the cluster. Initially the document is stored only in RAM.</li>

        <li class="li">The document is communicated to the indexer through replication to be indexed by views.</li>

      </ol>

      
      <p class="p">This sequence means that the view results are eventually consistent with what is stored in
        memory based on the latency in replication of the change to the indexer. It is possible to
        write a document to the cluster and access the index without the newly written document
        appearing in the generated view.</p>

        
      
      <p class="p">Conversely, documents that have been stored with an expiry may continue to be included 
        within the view until the document has been removed from the database by the expiry pager.</p>

      
      <p class="p">Couchbase Server supports the Observe command, which enables the current state of a document and 
        whether the document has been replicated to the indexer or whether it has been considered for inclusion in an index.
      </p>

      <p class="p">When accessing a view, the contents of the view are asynchronous to the stored documents. 
        In addition, the creation and updating of the view is subject to the <span class="keyword option">stale</span> parameter. 
        This controls how and when the view is updated when the view content is queried.
