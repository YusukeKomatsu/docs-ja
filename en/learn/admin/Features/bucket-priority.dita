 <title>Disk I/O priority</title>

 <shortdesc>Disk I/O priority permits for workload priorities to be set at the bucket level.</shortdesc>
 
 <conbody>

   <p>Bucket priority settings can be specified at the bucket-level. 
    The bucket disk I/O priority can be set as either high or low, whereas, low is the default. 
    Bucket priority settings determine whether I/O tasks for a bucket are enqueued in either low or high priority task queues. 
    Threads in the global pool poll the high priority task queues more often compared to the low priority task queues. 
    Bucket latency and I/O operations are impacted by the setting value. 
    When a bucket has a high priority, its I/O tasks are picked up at a high frequency and, thus, are able to processed faster compared to 
    tasks belonging to a low priority bucket.</p>
   
  
  <p>The default buckets settings can be set during initial setup and edited after setup. 
   However, changing bucket priority after setup results in a restart of the bucket and reset of the client connections.</p>

  <section><title>Backward compatibility</title>
   <p>When upgrading from a 2.x release to a 3.x release, 
    Couchbase converts an existing thread value to either a low or a high priority based on the following:
   </p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>Buckets allocated six to eight (6-8) threads are high priority. </li>
    <li>Buckets allocated three to five (3-5) threads are low priority. </li>
   </ul>
