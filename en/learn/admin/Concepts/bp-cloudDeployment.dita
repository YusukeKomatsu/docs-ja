  <title>Couchbase in the cloud</title>
  <shortdesc>Couchbase Server is extremely easy to deploy in the cloud.</shortdesc>
  
  <body>
    <p>From the software’s perspective, there is really no difference between being installed on
      bare-metal or virtualized operating systems. On the other hand, the management and deployment
      characteristics of the cloud warrant a separate discussion on the best ways to use 
      Couchbase Server.</p>
    <p>For the purposes of this discussion, “the cloud” is referred to as Amazon’s EC2 environment
      since that is by far the most common cloud-based environment. However, the same considerations
      apply to any environment that acts like EC2 (an organization’s private cloud, for example). In
      terms of the software itself, extensive testing has been done within EC2 and a variety of
      issues, exposed by sometimes unpredictable characteristics of this environment, have been
      encountered and resolved.</p>

    <p>A number of RightScale templates are supplied to help you deploy within Amazon and to try
      them out sign up for a free RightScale account. These templates handle almost all of the
      special configuration aspects needed to make your experience within EC2 successful. Direct
      integration with RightScale enables Couchbase to achieve new results in auto-scaling and
      prepackaged deployment.</p>
    <p>There is also an AMI for use within EC2 that is independent from RightScale. However, if you
      decide to use it you will have to handle the specific complexities yourself. You can find this
      AMI by searching for "couchbase" in the Amazon’s EC2 portal.</p>
    <p>When deploying within the cloud, consider the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Local storage being ephemeral</li>
      <li>IP addresses of a server changing from run time to run time</li>
      <li>Security groups and firewall settings</li>
   
    </ul>
    <section><title>Handling instance reboot in the cloud</title>
    <p>Many cloud providers warn users that they need to reboot certain instances for maintenance.
        Couchbase Server ensures these reboots won’t disrupt your application. Take the
        following steps to make that happen:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Install Couchbase Server on the new node.</li>
      <li>From Couchbase Web Console, add the new node to the cluster.</li>
      <li>From Couchbase Web Console, remove the node that you wish to reboot.</li>
      <li>Rebalance the cluster.</li>
      <li>Shut down the instance.</li>
    </ol>
    </section>
    
    <section><title>Local storage</title><p>Dealing with local storage is not very much different than a data center deployment. However, EC2
        provides an interesting solution: using the EBS storage you can prevent data loss when an
        instance fails. Writing Couchbase data and configuration to EBS creates a reliable medium of
        storage. There is direct support for using EBS within RightScale that you can set it up
        manually.</p><p>Using EBS is
        definitely not required, but you should make sure to follow the best practices around
        performing backups.</p><p>Keep in mind that you will have to update the per-node disk path when configuring the Couchbase
        Server to the point you have mounted an external volume.</p></section>
    
    
    <section><title>Handling changes in the IP addresses</title><p>When you use Couchbase Server in the cloud, server nodes can use internal or public IP
        addresses. Because IP addresses in the cloud can change quite frequently, you can configure
        Couchbase Server to use a hostname instead of an IP address.</p><p>For Amazon EC2,Amazon-generated hostnames are recommended that will automatically resolve to
        either an internal or external address.</p><p>By default, Couchbase Server uses specific IP addresses as a unique identifier. If the IP
        changes, an individual node will not be able to identify its own address, and other servers
        in the same cluster will not be able to access it. To configure Couchbase Server
        instances in the cloud to use hostnames, follow the steps later in this section. Note that
        RightScale server templates provided by Couchbase can automatically configure a node with a
        provided hostname.</p><p>Make sure that your hostname always resolves to the IP address of the node. This can be
        accomplished by using a dynamic DNS service such as <codeph>DNSMadeEasy</codeph> which will
        allow you to automatically update the hostname when an underlying IP address changes.</p><p>The following steps completely destroys any data and configuration from the node, so you should
        start with a fresh Couchbase installation. If you already have a running cluster, you can
        rebalance a node out of the cluster, make the change, and then rebalance it back into the
        cluster. </p><p>Nodes with both IPs and hostnames can exist in the same
        cluster. When you set the IP address using this method, you should not specify the address
        as <codeph>localhost</codeph> or <codeph>127.0.0.1</codeph> as this will be invalid when
        used as the identifier for multiple nodes within the cluster. Instead, use the correct IP
        address for your host.</p><p><b>Linux and Windows 2.1 and above</b></p><p>As a rule, you
        should set the hostname before you add a node to a cluster. You can also provide a hostname
        in these ways: when you install a Couchbase Server node or when you do a REST API call
        before the node is part of a cluster. You can also add a hostname to an existing cluster for
        an online upgrade. If you restart, any hostname you establish with one of these methods will
        be used. </p>
      <p><b>Linux and Windows 2.0.1 and earlier</b></p><p>For Couchbase Server 2.0.1 and earlier you must follow a manual process where you edit
        configuration files for each node, as described for Couchbase in the cloud. </p></section>
    
    
    <section><title>Security groups/firewall settings</title><p>It’s important to make sure you have
        both allowed AND restricted access to the appropriate ports in a Couchbase deployment. Nodes
        must be able to talk to one another on various ports, and it is important to restrict
        both external and internal access to only authorized individuals. Unlike a typical data center
        deployment, cloud systems are open to the world by default, and steps must be taken to
        restrict
      access.</p></section>
  
    
    <section><title>Using Couchbase Server on RightScale</title><p>Couchbase partners with RightScale to provide preconfigured RightScale
          ServerTemplates that you can use to create an individual or array of
        servers and start them as a cluster.  RightScale ServerTemplates enable you
        to quickly set up Couchbase Server on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) servers
        in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud through RightScale. </p><p>The templates also provide support
        for Amazon Elastic
          Block Store (Amazon EBS) standard volumes and Provisioned IOPS volumes. (IOPS is an
        acronym for input/output operations per second.) For more information about Amazon EBS
        volumes and their capabilities and limitations, see Amazon EBS Volume Types. </p><p>RightScale ServerTemplates are provided based on Chef and, for compatibility with existing
        systems, non-Chef-based ServerTemplates. </p>
      
      <note type="note">Beginning with Couchbase Server 2.2, non-Chef
        templates are deprecated. Do not choose non-Chef templates for new installations.
        </note>
      
      <p>Before you can set up Couchbase Server on RightScale, you need a RightScale account and
        an AWS account that is connected to your RightScale account. </p><p>At a minimum, you need RightScale user role privileges to work with the Couchbase RightScale
          ServerTemplates: actor, designer, library, observer, and server_login. To
        add privileges: from the RightScale menu bar, click <b>Settings &gt; Account Settings &gt;
          Users</b> and modify the permission list.</p><p>To set up Couchbase Server on RightScale, you need to import and customize a
          ServerTemplate. After the template is customized, you can launch server
        and cluster instances. The following figure illustrates the workflow:</p>

      <p>The following
        procedures do not describe every parameter that you can modify when working with the
        RightScale ServerTemplates. If you need more information about a parameter, click the info
        button located near the parameter name.</p><p><b>To import Couchbase Server RightScale

        address is 192.236.176.4, enter <codeph>http://192.236.176.4:8091/</codeph> in the web
