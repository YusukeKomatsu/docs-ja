 <title>Data Buckets</title>
 <body>
  <p>Couchbase Server provides a range of statistics and settings through the <codeph>Data
    Buckets</codeph> and <codeph>Server Nodes</codeph>. These show overview and detailed information
   so that administrators can better understand the current state of individual nodes and the
   cluster as a whole.</p>
  <p>The <codeph>Data Buckets</codeph> page displays a list of all the configured buckets on your
   system (of both Couchbase and memcached types). The page provides a quick overview of your
   cluster health from the perspective of the configured buckets, rather than whole cluster or
   individual servers.</p>
  <p>The information is shown in the form of a table, as seen in the figure below.</p>
  
    <image href="../images/web-console-data-buckets-overview.png" width="720"></image>
   
  <p>The list of buckets are separated by the bucket type. For each bucket, the following
   information is provided in each column:</p>
  <ul>
   <li><uicontrol>Bucket name</uicontrol> is the given name for the bucket. Clicking on the bucket name
     takes you to the individual bucket statistics page. </li>
   <li><uicontrol>RAM Usage/Quota</uicontrol> shows the amount of RAM used (for active objects) against
     the configure bucket size.</li>
   <li><uicontrol>Disk Usage</uicontrol> shows the amount of disk space in use for active object data
     storage.</li>
   <li><uicontrol>Item Count</uicontrol> indicates the number of objects stored in the bucket.</li>
   <li><codeph>Ops/sec</codeph> shows the number of operations per second for this data
     bucket.</li>
   <li><uicontrol>Disk Fetches/sec</uicontrol> shows the number of operations required to fetch items
     from disk.</li>
   <li>Clicking the <uicontrol>Bucket Name</uicontrol> opens the basic bucket information summary. </li>
   <li>Clicking the <uicontrol>Documents</uicontrol> button will take you to a list of objects
     identified as parseable documents.</li>
   <li>The <uicontrol>Views</uicontrol> button permits you to create and manage views on your stored
     objects.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To create a new data bucket, click the <uicontrol>Create New Data Bucket</uicontrol>.</p>

  
  <section><title>Creating and editing data buckets</title>
   <p>When creating a new data bucket, or
    editing an existing one, you will be presented with the bucket configuration screen. From here
    you can set the memory size, access control and other settings, depending on whether you are
    editing or creating a new bucket, and the bucket
    type.</p>
  
  <p>You can create a new bucket in Couchbase Web
    Console under the Data Buckets tab.</p>
   <ol>
    <li>Click Data Buckets | Create New Data Bucket. You see the <codeph>Create Bucket</codeph>
     panel, as follows: <image href="../images/mrw_create_bucket.png" width="720"/></li>
     
    <li>Select a name for the new bucket. 
     <p>The bucket name can only contain characters in range
      A-Z, a-z, 0–9 as well as underscore, period, dash and percent symbols.</p>
     <note type="tip">Create a named bucket specifically for your application. Any default
      bucket you initially set up with Couchbase Server should not be used for storing live
      application data. The default bucket you create when you first install Couchbase Server should
      be used only for testing.</note></li>
    <li>Select a Bucket Type, either Memcached or Couchbase.
      <p>The options that appear in this panel differ based on the bucket
      type.</p>
     <p>For <codeph>Couchbase</codeph> bucket type:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><b>Memory Size</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p>The amount of available RAM on this server which should be allocated to the bucket. Note
      that the allocation is the amount of memory that will be allocated for this bucket on each
      node, not the total size of the bucket across all nodes.</p>
     <ul>
      <li><b>Replicas</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p>For Couchbase buckets you can enable data replication so that the data is copied to other
      nodes in a cluster. You can configure up to three replicas per bucket. If you set this to one,
      you need to have a minimum of two nodes in your cluster and so forth. If a node in a cluster
      fails, after you perform failover, the replicated data will be made available on a functioning
      node. This provides continuous cluster operations in spite of machine failure. </p>
     <p>You can disable replication by deselecting the <codeph>Enable</codeph> check box.</p>
     <p>You can disable replication by setting the number of replica copies to zero (0).</p>
     <p>To configure replicas, Select a number in <codeph>Number of replica (backup) copies</codeph>
      drop-down list.</p>
     <p>To enable replica indexes, Select the <codeph>Index replicas</codeph> check box. Couchbase
      Server can also create replicas of indexes. This ensures that indexes do not need to be
      rebuilt in the event of a node failure. This will increase network load as the index
      information is replicated along with the data.</p>
     <ul>
      <li><b>Disk Read-Write Concurrency</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p>Multiple readers and writers are supported to persist data onto disk. For earlier versions
      of Couchbase Server, each server instance had only single disk reader and writer threads. By
      default this is set to three total threads per data bucket, with two reader threads and one
      writer thread for the bucket.</p>
     <p>For now, leave this setting at the default. In the future, when you create new data buckets
      you can update this setting. </p>
     <ul>
      <li><b>Flush</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p>To enable the operation for a bucket, click the <codeph>Enable</codeph> check box. Enable or
      disable support for the Flush command, which deletes all the data in an a bucket. The default
      is for the flush operation to be disabled.</p>
     <p>For <codeph>Memcached</codeph> bucket type:</p>
     <ul>
      <li><b>Memory Size</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p>The bucket is configured with a per-node amount of memory. Total bucket memory will change
      as nodes are added/removed.</p>
     <p><b>Warning</b>: Changing the size of a memcached bucket will erase all the data in the
      bucket and recreate it, resulting in loss of all stored data for existing buckets.</p>
     <ul>
      <li><b>Auto-Compaction</b></li>
     </ul>
     <p>Both data and index information stored on disk can become fragmented. Compaction rebuilds
      the stored data on index to reduce the fragmentation of the data. </p>
     <p>You can opt to override the default auto compaction settings for this individual bucket.
      Default settings are configured through the <codeph>Settings</codeph> menu.  
      If you override the default autocompaction settings, you can
      configure the same parameters, but the limits will affect only this bucket.</p>
     <p>For either bucket type provide these two settings in the Create Bucket panel:</p>
     
     <ul>
      <li><uicontrol>Access Control</uicontrol>
     <p>The access control configures the port clients use to communicate with the data bucket, and
      whether the bucket requires a password.</p>
     <p>To use the TCP standard port (11211), the first bucket you create can use this port without
      requiring SASL authentication. For each subsequent bucket, you must specify the password to be
      used for SASL authentication, and client communication must be made using the binary
      protocol.</p>
     <p>To use a dedicated port, select the dedicate port radio button and enter the port number you
      want to use. Using a dedicated port supports both the text and binary client protocols, and
      does not require authentication.</p>
     <p>Note: When defining a port on a bucket, the server automatically starts up a copy of Moxi on
      the servers, and exposes it on that port. This supports the ASCII memcached protocol. However,
      Couchbase strongly recommend against using Moxi in this way. If needed, a client-side Moxi
      should be installed on the application servers and have it connect to this bucket (whether it
      is “port” or “password” doesn’t matter).</p>
     <p>When defining a password on a bucket, it requires a client that supports the binary
      memcached protocol with SASL (all Couchbase client libraries and client-side Moxi provide this
      support). Defining a password on a bucket is the recommended approach.</p>
      </li>
     <li><b>Flush</b>
     <p>Enable or disable support for the Flush command, which deletes all the data in an a bucket.
      The default is for the flush operation to be disabled. To enable the operation for a bucket,
      select the Enable check box.</p></li>
    <li>Click <uicontrol>Create</uicontrol>.</li>
     </ul>

  <section><title>Editing Couchbase buckets</title><p>You can edit a number of settings for an
    existing Couchbase bucket in Couchbase Web Console:</p>
   <ul>
    <li><uicontrol>Access Control</uicontrol>, including the standard port/password or custom port
      settings.</li>
    <li><uicontrol>Memory Size</uicontrol> can be modified providing you have unallocated space within
      your Cluster configuration. You can reduce the amount of memory allocated to a bucket if that
      space is not already in use.</li>
    <li><uicontrol>Auto-Compaction</uicontrol> settings, including enabling the override of the default
      auto-compaction settings, and bucket-specific auto-compaction.</li>
