  <title>Installing on RHEL</title><shortdesc>Install Couchbase Server on RHEL using the <cmdname>rpm</cmdname> command-line tool with the downloaded RPM
    package.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <note type="important">RHEL6 and other newer Linux distributions, running both on physical
      hardware and on virtual machines, are known to have <term>transparent huge pages</term>
      feature enabled. It is strongly recommended to disable the <wintitle>transparent huge
        pages</wintitle> feature when installing Couchbase Server.</note>
    <section><title>Disable Transparent Huge Pages (THP)</title> To permanently disable both THP and
      THP defrag, the preferred method is to add the following to
      <filepath>/etc/rc.local</filepath>: <ul>
        <li>for i in <filepath>/sys/kernel/mm/*transparent_hugepage/enabled</filepath>; do
          <codeblock>echo never > $i; done </codeblock></li>
        <li>for i in <filepath>/sys/kernel/mm/*transparent_hugepage/defrag</filepath>; do
          <codeblock>echo never > $i; done  </codeblock></li>
      </ul><p>Alternatively, you can append the statement
          <codeph>transparent_hugepage=never</codeph> to the kernel boot line in
          <filepath>/etc/grub.conf</filepath>, which will disable THP but not THP defrag. This
        method can be used when it is not desirable to maintain a file
          <filepath>/etc/rc.local</filepath>. </p><p>Either method requires a restart of the
        operating system.  </p></section>  
    <section><title>Complete the installation</title>
    <p> Log in as root (superuser) to complete the installation:</p>
      <codeblock>
root-&gt; rpm --install couchbase-server-<varname>version</varname>.rpm 
     </codeblock>
      <p>where <varname>version</varname> is the version number of the downloaded package.</p>
      <p>After the <cmdname>rpm</cmdname> command completes, the Couchbase Server starts automatically. It 
        is configured to automatically start during boot under the 2, 3, 4, and 5 runlevels. Refer to
        the Red Hat RPM documentation for more information about installing packages using RPM.</p>
      <p>After installation is completed, the installation process displays a message similar to the following:</p>
      <codeblock>
Minimum RAM required : 4 GB 
    System RAM configured : 8174464 KB
    Minimum number of processors required :  4 cores 
    Number of processors on the system : 4 cores
