  <title>Provisioning nodes</title>
  <shortdesc>Provisioning refers to creating a new cluster or adding a node to a cluster.</shortdesc>
  <refbody>
    
    <section><title>Description</title>
    <p> To provision a node:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a new node by installing a new Couchbase Server.</li>
        <li>Configure disk path for the node.</li>
        <li>Optionally configure memory quota for each node within the cluster. 
          <p>Any nodes you add
          to a cluster will inherit the configured memory quota. The default memory quota for the
          first node in a cluster is 60% of the physical RAM.</p></li>
        <li>Add the node to your existing cluster.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Whether you are adding a node to an existing cluster or starting a new cluster, the nodeâ€™s
        disk path must be configured. Your next steps depends on whether you create a new cluster or
        add a node to an existing cluster. If you create a new cluster, secure it by providing an
        administrative username and password. If you add a node to an existing cluster, obtain the
        URI and credentials to use the REST API with that cluster.</p>
