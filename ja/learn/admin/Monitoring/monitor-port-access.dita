  <title>Port numbers and accessing different buckets</title>
  <body>
    <p>In a Couchbase Server cluster, any communication (stats or data) to a port <i>other</i> than
      11210 will result in the request going through a Moxi process. This means that any stats
      request will be aggregated across the cluster (and may produce some inconsistencies or
      confusion when looking at stats that are not “aggregatable”).</p>
    <p>In general, it is best to run all your stat commands against port 11210 which will always
      give you the information for the specific node that you are sending the request to. It is a
      best practice to then aggregate the relevant data across nodes at a higher level (in your own
      script or monitoring system).</p>
    <p>When you run the below commands (and all stats commands) without supplying a bucket name
      and/or password, they will return results for the default bucket and produce an error if one
      does not exist.</p>
    <p>To access a bucket other than the default, you will need to supply the bucket name and
      password on the end of the command. Any bucket created on a dedicated port does not require a
      password.</p>
    <p>The TCP/IP port allocation on Windows by default includes a restricted number of ports
      available for client communication. </p>
