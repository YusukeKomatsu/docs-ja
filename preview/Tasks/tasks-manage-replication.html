	<h1 class="title topictitle1">Handling replication</h1>

	
	<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Data replication is distributed throughout the Couchbase cluster to prevent a single
		point of failure. Data replication is configurable on a bucket-level and
		node-basis.</p>

		<p class="p">Within a Couchbase cluster, you have <dfn class="term">active data</dfn> and <dfn class="term">replica data</dfn> on
			each node. Active data is data that was written by a client on that node. Replica data
			is a copy of an item from another node. </p>

		<p class="p">After writing an item to Couchbase Server, it makes a copy of this data from the RAM of
			one node to another node. Distribution of replica data is handled in the same way as
			active data: portions of replica data is distributed around the Couchbase cluster to
			different nodes to prevent a single point of failure.</p>


		<p class="p">Replication of data between nodes is entirely peer-to-peer based so that information is
			replicated directly between nodes in the cluster. There is no topology, hierarchy, or
			master-slave relationship between nodes in a cluster. When a client writes to a node in
			the cluster, Couchbase Server stores the data on that node and then distributes the data
			to one or more nodes within a cluster. </p>

		<p class="p">The following diagram shows two different nodes in a Couchbase cluster and illustrates
			how two nodes can store replica data for one another:</p>


		<img class="image" src="../images/replica_backoff.png" width="720">


		<p class="p">When a client application writes data to a node, that data is placed in a replication queue and
			then a copy is sent to another node. The replicated data is then available in RAM on the
			second node and placed in a disk write queue to be stored on disk at the second
			node.</p>

		<p class="p">The second node also simultaneously handles both replica data and incoming writes from a
			client. It puts both replica data and incoming writes into a disk write queue. If there
			are too many items in the disk write queue, this second node can send a <dfn class="term">backoff
				message</dfn> to the first node. The first node will then reduce the rate at which
			it sends items to the second node for replication. This is sometimes necessary if
			the second node is already handling a large volume of writes from a client
			application.</p>

		<p class="p">If multiple changes occur to the same document waiting to be replicated, Couchbase Server can
			<dfn class="term">deduplicate</dfn> the item. This means that, for the sake of efficiency, it only sends the latest
			version of a document to the second node.</p>

		<p class="p">If the first node fails in the system, the replicated data is still available at the second
			node. Couchbase can serve replica data from the second node nearly instantaneously because
			the second node already has a copy of the data in RAM. There is no need for the data to be
			copied over from the failed node or to be fetched from disk. Once replica data is enabled
			at the second node, Couchbase Server updates a map indicating where the data should be
			retrieved, and the server shares this information with client applications. Client
			applications can then get the replica data from the functioning node.</p>

		
		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Providing data replication</h2>
		<p class="p">You can configure
			different buckets to have different levels of data replication, depending how many
			copies of your data you need. For the highest level of data redundancy and availability,
			you can specify that a data bucket will be replicated three times within the
			cluster.</p>

		<p class="p">Replication is enabled once the number of nodes in your cluster meets the number of
			replicas you specify. For example, if you configure three replicas for a data bucket,
			replication will only be enabled once you have four nodes in the cluster.</p>

		
		<p class="p">After you specify the number of replicas you want for a bucket and then create the
			bucket, you cannot change the value. Therefore be certain you specify the number of
			replicas you truly want.</p>
