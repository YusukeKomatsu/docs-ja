	<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Couchbase Server is a NoSQL document database for interactive web applications. It has
		a flexible data model, is easily scalable, provides consistent high performance and is
		“always-on,” meaning it can serve application data 24 hours, 7 days a week.</p>


		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Couchbase benefits</h2> <p class="p">With Couchbase Server, JSON documents are used to
			represent application objects and the relationships between objects. This document model is
			flexible enough so that you can change application objects without having to migrate the
			database schema, or plan for significant application downtime. Even the same type of object
			in your application can have different data structures. For instance, you can initially
			represent a user name as a single document field. You can later structure a user document
			so that the first name and last name are separate fields in the JSON document without any
			downtime and without having to update all user documents in the system.</p>
 
			<ul class="ul">
				<li class="li">Flexible data model <p class="p">The other advantage in a flexible, document-based data model
						is that it is well suited to representing real world items and how you want to
						represent them. JSON documents support nested structures, as well as fields
						representing relationships between items which enable you to realistically
						represent objects in your application.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">Easy scalability <p class="p">It is easy to scale your application with Couchbase Server, both
						within a cluster of servers and between clusters at different data centers. You
						can add instances of Couchbase Server to address increases in users and
						application data without any interruptions or changes in your application code.
						With a single click of a button, you can rapidly grow your cluster of Couchbase
						Servers to handle additional work and keep data evenly
						distributed.</p>
<p class="p">Couchbase Server provides automatic sharding of data and
						rebalancing at runtime; this lets you resize your server cluster on demand.
						Cross-data center replication enables you to move data closer to your users at
						other data centers.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">Consistent high performance <p class="p">Couchbase Server is designed for massively concurrent
						data use and consistent high throughput. It provides consistent sub-millisecond
						response times which help ensure an enjoyable experience for users of your
						application. By providing consistent, high data throughput, Couchbase Server
						enables you to support more users with less servers. The server also automatically
						spreads workload across all servers to maintain consistent performance and reduce
						bottlenecks at any given server in a cluster.</p>

				</li>

				<li class="li">"Always online" <p class="p">Couchbase Server provides consistent sub-millisecond response
						times which help ensure an enjoyable experience for users of your application. By
						providing consistent, high data throughput, Couchbase Server enables you to
						support more users with less servers. The server also automatically spreads
						workload across all servers to maintain consistent performance and reduce
						bottlenecks at any given server in a cluster.</p>
<p class="p">Features such as cross-data
						center replication, failover, and backup and restore help ensure availability of
						data during server or datacenter failure.</p>

				</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">All of these features of Couchbase Server enable development of web applications where
				low–latency and high throughput are required by end users. Web applications can quickly
				access the right information within a Couchbase cluster and developers can rapidly scale
				up their web applications by adding servers.</p>

		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Couchbase Server and NoSQL</h2>
			<p class="p">NoSQL databases are characterized by their ability to store data without first requiring
				one to define a database schema. In Couchbase Server, you can store data as key-value
				pairs or JSON documents. Data does not need to confirm to a rigid, pre-defined schema
				from the perspective of the database management system. Due to this schema-less nature,
				Couchbase Server supports a scale out approach to growth, increasing data and I/O
				capacity by adding more servers to a cluster; and without any change to application
				software. In contrast, relational database management systems scale up by adding more
				capacity including CPU, memory and disk to accommodate growth.</p>

			<p class="p">Relational databases store information in relations which must be defined, or modified,
				before data can be stored. A relation is simply a table of rows, where each row in a
				given relation has a fixed set of columns. These columns are consistent across each row
				in a relation. Tables can be further connected through cross-table references. One
				table, could hold rows of all individual citizens residing in a town. Another table,
				could have rows consisting of parent, child and relationship fields. The first two
				fields could be references to rows in the citizens table while the third field describes
				the parental relationship between the persons in the first two fields such as father or
				mother.</p>
