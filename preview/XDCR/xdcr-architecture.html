  <h1 class="title topictitle1">XDCR architecture</h1>

  <div class="body">
    <p class="p">There are a number of key elements in Couchbase Server’s XDCR architecture including:</p>

    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Continuous Replication.</strong> XDCR in Couchbase Server provides continuous replication
      across geographically distributed datacenters. Data mutations are replicated to the
      destination cluster after they are written to disk. There are multiple data streams (32 by
      default) that are shuffled across all shards (called vBuckets in Couchbase Server) on the
      source cluster to move data in parallel to the destination cluster. The vBucket list is
      shuffled so that replication is evenly load balanced across all the servers in the cluster.
      The clusters scale horizontally, more the servers, more the replication streams, faster the
      replication rate. </p>

    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Cluster Aware.</strong> XDCR is cluster topology aware. The source and destination clusters
      could have different number of servers. If a server in the source or destination cluster goes
      down, XDCR is able to get the updated cluster topology information and continue replicating
      data to available servers in the destination cluster.</p>

    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Push based connection resilient replication.</strong> XDCR in Couchbase Server is push-based
      replication. The source cluster regularly checkpoints the replication queue per vBucket and
      keeps track of what data the destination cluster last received. If the replication process is
      interrupted for example due to a server crash or intermittent network connection failures, it
      is not required to restart replication from the beginning. Instead, once the replication link
      is restored, replication can continue from the last checkpoint seen by the destination
      cluster.</p>

    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Efficient.</strong> For the sake of efficiency, Couchbase Server is able to de-duplicate
      information that is waiting to be stored on disk. For instance, if there are three changes to
      the same document in Couchbase Server, and these three changes are waiting in queue to be
      persisted, only the last version of the document is stored on disk and later gets pushed into
      the XDCR queue to be replicated.</p>

    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Active-Active Conflict Resolution.</strong> Within a cluster, Couchbase Server provides strong
      consistency at the document level. On the other hand, XDCR also provides eventual consistency
      across clusters. Built-in conflict resolution will pick the same “winner” on both the clusters
      if the same document was mutated on both the clusters. If a conflict occurs, the document with
      the most updates will be considered the “winner.” If the same document is updated the same
      number of times on the source and destination, additional metadata such as numerical sequence,
      CAS value, document flags and expiration TTL value are used to pick the “winner.” XDCR applies
      the same rule across clusters to make sure document consistency is maintained:</p>

    
        <img class="image" src="../images/xdcr_conflict_res.png" width="720">
    <p class="p">As shown in above, bidirectional replication is set up between Datacenter 1 and Datacenter 2
      and both the clusters start off with the same JSON document (Doc 1). In addition, two
      additional updates to Doc 1 happen on Datacenter 2. In the case of a conflict, Doc 1 on
      Datacenter 2 is chosen as the winner because it has seen more updates.</p>
