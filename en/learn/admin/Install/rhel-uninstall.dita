    <p>Before removing Couchbase Server:
      <ul>
        <li>Shut down Couchbase Server. </li>
        <li>If your machine is a part of an active cluster, rebalance the cluster to take
          the node out of the configuration. </li>
        <li>Update any clients to point to an available node within the Couchbase Server cluster.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>Run the following command:</p>
    
    <codeblock> &gt; sudo rpm -e couchbase-server</codeblock>
  
    <p>You might need to delete the data files associated with your installation. 
      The default installation location is <filepath>/opt</filepath>. 
      If an alternative location for your data files was specified, each data directory must be individually deleted from your system.</p>
