  <title>XDCR pause and resume replication</title>
  <shortdesc>During XDCR replication, the process can be paused and resumed.</shortdesc>
  
  <body>
    <p>XDCR streams between the source and destination cluster can be paused and later resumed. 
      After XDCR is resumed, data continues to replicate between the source and destination clusters
      starting from where it previously left off.
