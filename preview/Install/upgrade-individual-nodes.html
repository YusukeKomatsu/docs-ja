  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Upgrading one node</h1>

  
  <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">To upgrade a single Couchbase Server node, first back it up and then install the
    software.</p>

    <p class="p">Steps for upgrading a Couchbase Server node explained in this section are identical for an
      online upgrade (for a node that has been removed from the cluster) or an offline upgrade (for
      a node that has not yet been added to the cluster).</p>

 
    
    <ol class="ol">
        <li class="li">Download Couchbase Server software.</li>

        <li class="li">Back up data for that server. To back up an existing Couchbase Server installation, use
         <span class="keyword cmdname">cbbackup</span>. </li>

        <li class="li">Back up the server-specific configuration files. While the upgrade scripts perform a
          backup of the configuration and data files, make your own
          backup of these files as the best practices rule.</li>

        <li class="li">Stop Couchbase Server instance.</li>

        <li class="li">Check your host name configuration. If you have deployed Couchbase Server in a cloud
          service, or if you are using hostnames rather than IP addresses, you must verify that the
          hostname has been configured correctly before performing the upgrade. </li>

        <li class="li">Check for required components and, if needed, install them. This ensures that Couchbase
        Server can be upgraded and migrates the existing data files. </li>

        <li class="li">Perform the installation upgrade for your platform.</li>

      </ol>
