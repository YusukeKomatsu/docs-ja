  <title>Resource requirements</title><shortdesc>Specifications for installing Couchbase Server.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <section><title>Recommended specification</title>
    <p>To install Couchbase Server, follow these guidelines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Quad-core for key-value store, 64-bit CPU running at 3GHz.</p></li>
      <li><p>Six cores if XDCR (Cross Data Center Replication) and views are used.</p></li>
      <li><p>16GB RAM (physical).</p></li>
      <li><p>Block-based storage device (hard disk, SSD, EBS, iSCSI). Network filesystems such as 
          CIFS and  NFS are not supported.</p></li>
    </ul></section>
    <section><title>Minimum specification</title>
    <p>A machine with minimum specifications must have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dual-core CPU running at 2GHz for key-value store.</li>
      <li>4GB RAM (physical).</li>
    </ul>
        <note type="note">For development and testing purposes, you can use reduced CPU and RAM
      resources compared to the specified minimum. This can be as low as 1GB of free RAM beyond operating
      system requirements and a single CPU core. For production, however, the minumum specification
      must be implemented. </note>
    <note type="note">Performance on machines configured with specifications lower than the minimum is
      significantly lower and cannot be used as an indication of the performance on a production
      machine. View performance on machines with less than 2 CPU cores is significantly
      reduced.</note></section>
   <section><title>Memory requirements</title></section>
    <p>Your machine must have enough memory to run the operating system and Couchbase Server. 
      For example, if 8GB of RAM is dedicated to Couchbase Server, there must be also 
      enough RAM to host the operating system. If additional applications and servers are running,
      additional RAM is required. For smaller systems, such as those with less than 16GB, allocate
      at least 40% of RAM to the operating system.</p>
    <section><title>Storage requirements</title>
    <p>The following amount of storage must be available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1GB for application logging.</li>
      <li>At least twice the disk space to match the physical RAM for persistence of
          information.</li>
    </ul>
    </section>
  <section><title>CLI utilities requirements </title>
    Couchbase command line utilities require that Python version 2.6 or greater be installed on the system so that they can function properly.
