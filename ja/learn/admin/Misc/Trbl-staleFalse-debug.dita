   <title>Debugging stale=false queries</title>
   <shortdesc>Debugging stale=false queries for missing/unexpected data</shortdesc>
   <body>
      <p>The query parameter <codeph>debug=true</codeph> can be used to debug queries with
            <codeph>stale=false</codeph> that are not returning all expected data or return
         unexpected data. This is particularly useful when clients issue a
            <codeph>stale=false</codeph> query right after being unblocked by a memcached OBSERVE
         command. .</p>
      <p>Here follows an example of how to debug this sort of issues on a simple scenario where
         thereâ€™s only 16 vbuckets (instead of 1024) and 2 nodes. The tools
            <codeph>couchdb_dump</codeph> and <codeph>couchdb_info</codeph> (from the couchstore git
         project) are used to help analyze this type of issues (available under
            <codeph>install/bin</codeph> directory).</p>
      <p>Querying a view with <codeph>debug=true</codeph> will add an extra field, named
            <codeph>debug_info</codeph> in the view response. This field has one entry per node in
         the cluster (if no errors happened, like down/timed out nodes for example). Example:</p>
      <codeblock><codeph>&gt; curl -s 'http://localhost:9500/default/_design/test/_view/view1?stale=false&amp;limit=5&amp;debug=true' | json_xs

      <p>For each node, there are 2 particular fields of interest when debugging
            <codeph>stale=false</codeph> queries that apparently miss some data:</p>
      <ul>
         <li><p><codeph>wanted_seqs</codeph> - This field has an object (dictionary) value where
               keys are vbucket IDs and values are vbucket database sequence numbers for an
               explanation of sequence numbers). This field tells us the sequence number of each
               vbucket database file (at the corresponding node) at the moment the query arrived at
               the server (all these vbuckets are <codeph>active vbuckets</codeph> ).</p></li>
         <li><p><codeph>indexable_seqs</codeph> - This field has an object (dictionary) value where
               keys are vbucket IDs and values are vbucket database sequence numbers. This field
               tells us, for each active vbucket database, up to which sequence the index has
               processed/indexed documents (remember, each vbucket database sequence number is
               associated with 1, and only 1, document).</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>For queries with <codeph>stale=false</codeph>, all the sequences in
            <codeph>indexable_seqs</codeph> must be greater or equal then the sequences in
            <codeph>wanted_seqs</codeph> - otherwise the <codeph>stale=false</codeph> option can be
         considered broken. What happens behind the scenes is, at each node, when the query request
         arrives, the value for <codeph>wanted_seqs</codeph> is computed (by asking each active
         vbucket database for its current sequence number), and if any sequence is greater than the
         corresponding entry in <codeph>indexable_seqs</codeph> (stored in the index), the client is
         blocked, the indexer is started to update the index, the client is unblocked when the
         indexer finishes updating the index, and finally the server starts streaming rows to the
         client - note that at this point, all sequences in <codeph>indexable_seqs</codeph> are
         necessarily greater or equal then the corresponding sequences in
            <codeph>wanted_sequences</codeph>, otherwise the <codeph>stale=false</codeph>
         implementation is broken.</p>
