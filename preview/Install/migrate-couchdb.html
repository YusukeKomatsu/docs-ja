  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Migrating from CouchDB</h1>

  <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Migration guidelines for CouchDB users</p>

    <p class="p">Although Couchbase Server incorporates the
      view engine functionality built into CouchDB, most of the remaining functionality is
      supported through the components and systems of Membase Server.</p>
<p class="p">This change introduces
        a number of significant differences for CouchDB users who want to use Couchbase Server,
        particularly when migrating existing applications. However, they also gain the scalability
        and performance advantages of the Membase Server components.</p>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Differences in terms and concepts</h2><p class="p">CouchDB stores 
      information using the concept of a document ID (either
      explicit or automatically generated), against which the document (JSON) is stored. Within
      Couchbase there is no document ID, and information is stored in the form of a
      key-value pair instead. The key is equivalent to the document ID, the value is
      equivalent to the document, and the format of the data is the same.</p>

      <p class="p">Almost all of the
        HTTP REST API that makes up the interface for communicating with CouchDB does not exist
        within Couchbase Server. The basic document operations for creating, retrieving, updating
        and deleting information are entirely supported by the memcached protocol.</p>

      <p class="p">Also,
          beyond views, many of the other operations are unsupported at the client level within
          CouchDB. For example, you cannot create a new database as a client, store attachments, or
          perform administration-style functions, such as view compaction.</p>

      <p class="p">Couchbase Server
            does not support the notion of databases. Instead, information is stored within logical
            containers called <dfn class="term">Buckets</dfn>. These are logically equivalent and can be used to
            compartmentalize information according to projects or needs. With <dfn class="term">Buckets</dfn> you get the
            additional capability to determine the number of replicas of the information, and the port
            and authentication required to access the information.</p>
</div>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Consistent functionality</h2><p class="p">The operation and interface
      for querying and creating view definitions in Couchbase Server are mostly identical. Views
      are still based on the combination of map/reduce functions, and you can 
      port your map/reduce definitions to Couchbase Server without any issues. The main
      difference is that the view does not output the document ID. Instead, it 
      outputs the key against which the key-value was stored into the database.</p>

      <p class="p">Querying
        views is also the same, and you can use the same arguments to perform a query, such as a start and
        end docIDs, returned row counts and query value specification, including the requirement
        to express your key in the form of a JSON value if you are using compound (array or hash)
        types in your view key specification. Stale views are also supported, and just as with
        CouchDB, accessing a stale view prevents Couchbase Server from updating the
        index.</p>
</div>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Changed functionality</h2><p class="p">There are many changes in the
      functionality and operation of Couchbase Server compared to CouchDB:</p>

      <pre class="pre codeblock">* Basic data storage operations must use the memcached API.

* Explicit replication is unsupported. Replication between nodes within a cluster
  is automatically configured and enabled and is used to help distribute
  information around the cluster.

* You cannot replicate between a CouchDB database and Couchbase Server.

* Explicit attachments are unsupported, but you can store additional files as new
  key-value pairs into the database.

* CouchApps are unsupported.

* Update handlers, document validation functions, and filters are not supported.

* Futon does not exist, instead there is an entire Web Administration Console
  built into Couchbase Server that provides cluster configuration, monitoring and
  view/document update functionality.
</pre>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Operational and deployment differences</h2><p class="p">The major differences between CouchDB and Couchbase Server are in options
      for clustering and distribution of information. With CouchDB, 
      you need to handle the replication of information between multiple nodes and then
      use a proxy service to distribute the load from clients over multiple machines.</p>
<p class="p">With
        Couchbase Server, the distribution of information is automatic within the cluster, and any
        Couchbase Server client library will automatically handle and redirect queries to the
        server that holds the information as it is distributed around the cluster. </p>
</div>

    
    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Client and application changes</h2><p class="p">As your CouchDB based
      application already uses JSON for the document information and a document ID to identify
      each document, the bulk of your application logic and view support remain identical.
      However, the HTTP REST API for basic CRUD operations must be updated to use the memcached
      protocol.</p>
<p class="p">Additionally, because CouchApps are unsupported, you need to develop a
        client side application to support any application logic.</p>
