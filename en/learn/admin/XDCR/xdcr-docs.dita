  <title>XDCR document handling</title>
  <shortdesc>XDCR does not replicate views and view indexes.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>To replicate views and view indexes, manually
      exchange view definitions between clusters and re-generate the index on the destination
      cluster.</p>
    <p>Non UTF–8 encodable document IDs on the source cluster are automatically filtered out and
      logged. The IDs are not transferred to the remote cluster. If there are any non UTF–8 keys,
      the warning output, <codeph>xdcr_error.*</codeph> displays in the log files along with a list
      of all non-UTF–8 keys found by XDCR.</p>
