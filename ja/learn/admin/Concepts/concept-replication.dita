  <title>Replicas and replication</title>
  <shortdesc>Replicas are copies of data that are proved on another node in a cluster.</shortdesc>
  
  <body>
    <p>In addition to distributing information across the cluster for even data distribution and
      cluster performance, you can also establish <i>replica vBuckets</i> within a single Couchbase
      cluster.</p>
    <p>A copy of data from one bucket, known as a source is copied to a
        destination, which we also refer to as the replica, or replica vBucket. The node that
      contains the replica vBucket is also referred to as the <i>replica node</i> while the node
      containing original data to be replicated is called a <i>source node</i>. Distribution of
      replica data is handled in the same way as data at a source node; portions of replica data
      will be distributed around the cluster to prevent a single point of failure.</p>
    <p>After Couchbase has stored replica data at a destination node, the data will also be placed
      in a queue to be persisted on disk at that destination node. </p>
    <p>When replication is performed between two Couchbase clusters, it is called 
      cross datacenter replication (XDCR). 
      Use cases for XDCR is for a copy of your data on a cluster that is
      closer to your users or for backup data in case of disaster recovery.</p>
