  <title>Using hostnames</title><shortdesc>Each Couchbase Server's instance can have its own hostname.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>When you first install Couchbase Server, you can access it 
      using a default IP address. There are cases, however, when you want to provide a hostname for each
      instance of a server. Each hostname you provide must be a valid one and will ultimately
      resolve to a valid IP Address. If you restart a node, it will use
      the hostname once again. If you fail over or remove a node from a cluster, the node needs to
      be configured with the hostname once again.</p>
      
      <p>There are several ways you can provide hostnames: when installing a Couchbase Server on a
      machine, when adding a node to an existing cluster for online upgrade, or via a REST API call.
      Couchbase Server stores the hostnames in a config file on the disk.</p>
    <section><title>Provide hostname on initial setup</title>
      
         In the first screen, provide either a hostname or IP address under <wintitle>Configure
            Server Hostname</wintitle>. The provided hostname survives node restart.

    <section><title>Provide hostname while adding a node</title>
     
          If a new node is being added to an existing 2.0.1 or earlier
            Couchbase cluster, first set up the hostname for the new node in the setup
            wizard. Add a new node to a cluster by providing either a hostname or
            IP address under <menucascade>
              <uicontrol>Add Server</uicontrol><uicontrol>Server IP Address
              </uicontrol></menucascade>.

    <section><title>Provide hostname via REST API</title>
   
       Provide a host name for a node a host name with the REST request at the <filepath>/node/controller/rename endpoint</filepath>. 
          <p>If this method is used, provide the hostname before adding a node to a cluster. 
            If a hostname is provided for a node that is already part of a Couchbase cluster, 
            the server rejects the request and returns 
            <codeblock>error 400 reason: unknown ["Renaming is disallowed for nodes that are already part of a cluster"]</codeblock>
          <codeblock>curl -v -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd \
http://127.0.0.1:8091/node/controller/rename -d hostname=shz.localdomain</codeblock></p>

      <section><title>Hostname errors</title>
      <p>Provide the IP address and port for the node and administrative credentials for the
        cluster. The value you provide for <codeph>hostname</codeph> must be a valid hostname for
        the node. Possible errors that can occur:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><systemoutput>Could not resolve the host name. The host name you provide as a parameter does not
          resolve to a IP address.</systemoutput></li>
        <li><systemoutput>Could not listen. The host name resolves to an IP address, but no network connection
          exists for the address.</systemoutput></li>
        <li><systemoutput>Could not rename the node because name was fixed at server start-up.</systemoutput></li>
        <li><systemoutput>Could not save address after rename.</systemoutput></li>
        <li><systemoutput>Requested name host name is not allowed. Invalid host name provided.</systemoutput></li>
        <li><systemoutput>Renaming is disallowed for nodes that are already part of a cluster.</systemoutput></li>
      </ul>
