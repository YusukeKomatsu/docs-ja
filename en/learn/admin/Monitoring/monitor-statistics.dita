  <title>Couchbase Server statistics</title>
  <shortdesc>Couchbase Server provides statistics at multiple levels throughout the cluster.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The statistics
      used for regular monitoring, capacity planning and to identify the performance characteristics
      of your cluster deployment. The most visible statistics are those in the Web UI, but
      components such as the REST interface, the proxy and individual nodes have directly accessible
      statistics interfaces.</p>
    <section><title>REST interface statistics</title><p>To interact with statistics provided by
        REST, use the Couchbase web console. 
        This GUI gathers statistics via REST and displays them to your browser.
        The REST interface has a set of resources that provide access to the current and historic
        statistics the cluster gathers and stores.</p></section>
    
    <section><title>Couchbase Server node statistics</title><p>Detailed stats documentation can be found in the
        repository.</p><p>Along with stats at the REST and UI level, individual nodes can also be
        queried for statistics either through a client which uses binary protocol or through the
          cbstats utility.</p><p>For
        example:</p><codeblock><codeph>&gt; cbstats localhost:11210 all
 auth_cmds:                   9
 auth_errors:                 0
 bucket_conns:                10
 bytes_read:                  246378222
 bytes_written:               289715944
 cas_badval:                  0
 cas_hits:                    0
 cas_misses:                  0
 cmd_flush:                   0
 cmd_get:                     134250
 cmd_set:                     115750
…
</codeph></codeblock><p>The
        most commonly needed statistics are surfaced through the Web Console and have descriptions
        there and in the associated documentation. Software developers and system administrators
        wanting lower level information have it available through the stats interface.</p><p>There
        are seven commands available through the stats interface:</p><ul>
        <li><p><codeph>stats</codeph> (referred to as ‘all’)</p></li>
        <li><p><codeph>dispatcher</codeph></p></li>
        <li><p><codeph>hash</codeph></p></li>
        <li><p><codeph>tap</codeph></p></li>
        <li><p><codeph>timings</codeph></p></li>
        <li><p><codeph>vkey</codeph></p></li>
        <li><p><codeph>reset</codeph></p></li>
      </ul></section>
    <section><title>stats command</title><p>This displays a large list of statistics related to the
        Couchbase process including the underlying engine (ep_* stats).</p></section>
    <section><title>dispatcher command</title><p>This statistic shows what the dispatcher is
        currently
        doing:</p><codeblock><codeph>dispatcher
     runtime: 45ms
       state: dispatcher_running
      status: running
        task: Running a flusher loop.
nio_dispatcher
       state: dispatcher_running
      status: idle
</codeph></codeblock><p>The
        first entry, dispatcher, monitors the process responsible for disk access. The second entry
        is a non-IO (non disk) dispatcher. There may also be a ro_dispatcher present if
        the engine is allowing concurrent reads and writes. When a task is actually running on a
        given dispatcher, the “runtime” tells you how long the current task has been running. Newer
        versions will show you a log of recently run dispatcher jobs so you can see what’s been
        happening.</p></section>
    
    <section><title>Changing statistics collection</title>
      <p>The default Couchbase Server statistics
        collection is set to collect every second. The tuning that is available for statistic
        collection is by collecting statistics less frequently. </p>
      <note type="note">If statistic
        collection is changed from the default, the Couchbase service must be restarted.</note>
      
      <p>To change statistic collection:</p><ol>
        <li>Log in as root or sudo and navigate to the directory where Couchbase is installed. For
          example: <codeph>/opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/static_config</codeph></li>
        <li>Edit the static_config file.</li>
        <li>Add the following parameter: <codeph>grab_stats_every_n_ticks, 10</codeph>, where 10 is the number of
          ticks. In the Couchbase environment one tick is one second (default). It is recommended
          that the statistics collection be more frequent (and accurate). However, assign an
          appropriate tick value for you environment.</li>
        <li>Restart the Couchbase service.</li>
      </ol><p>After restarting the Couchbase service, the statistics collection rate is changed.</p></section>
    
    <section><title>Changing the stats file location</title><p>The default stats
          file location is <codeph>/opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/stats</codeph>, however, if you
          want to change the default stats file location, create a symlink location to the new
          directory.</p>
      <note type="note">When creating a symlink, stop and restart the Couchbase
          service. </note></section>
