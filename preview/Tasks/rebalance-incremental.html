  <div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">Improved rebalance latency of Couchbase Server is demonstrated through its ability to
    better resume rebalancing operation after any blips or failures have occurred in the
    process.</p>

    <p class="p">In case the rebalancing operation is interrupted at any point, it can be resumed instead of
      repeating the whole process.</p>
 
      <p class="p">Couchbase Server is able to perform incremental catch-up due to the
        <dfn class="term">restartability</dfn> option provided through DCP (Database Change Protocol). </p>

    <p class="p">With DCP, the improved rebalance latency is achieved through efficient data movement, which
      is characterized by better capability to resume operation after failures,  as well as to
      perform incremental catch-up.</p>
